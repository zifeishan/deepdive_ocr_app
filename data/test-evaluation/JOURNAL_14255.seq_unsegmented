Lithofacies, diagenesis and cyclicity of the ‘Lower Member’ of the Khuff Formation (Late Permian), Al Qasim Province, Saudi Arabia Abstract The ‘Lower Member’ of the Khuff Formation, exposed along the western margin of the Arabian Basin (Al Qasim Province, Saudi Arabia) comprises seven carbonate and two siliciclastic lithofacies. The carbonate lithofacies include laminated lime mudstone, ostracode wackestone, foraminiferal wackestone, intraclastic wackestone, burrowed dolostone, lithoclastic grainstone and caliche. The clastic lithofacies are represented by claystone and quartzarenite. These lithofacies are arranged vertically into shallowing-upward or emergence cycles, the boundaries between which were delineated by field observations. Peritidal as well as subtidal cycles built-up the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation. The peritidal cycles consist of laminated lime mudstone or subtidal claystone, overlain by intertidal burrowed dolostone, which is capped in most cases by supratidal lithoclastic grainstone, and locally by subaerial caliche deposits. These cycles were probably formed by allocyclic mechanism due to the effect of sea level changes and intrabasinal tectonics. The subtidal cycles comprise laminated lime mudstone, claystone, foraminiferal wackestone, and ostracode wackestone, capped by intertidal burrowed dolostone or intraclastic wackestone. These cycles may be formed due to internal factors, e.g. carbonate production, changes in water circulation, salinity, depth, chemistry, energy, temperature and nutrient content. Diagenetic studies on the depositional cycles show that the basal part of cycle (subtidal zone) includes micrite cementation, micritization and silicification. The middle part (intertidal zone) was affected by early dolomitization, while the upper part (supratidal zone) was subjected to dedolomitization, aggrading neomorphism, sparry calcite cementation and evaporite-carbonate replacement.

Introduction In Saudi Arabia, Permian carbonates are exposed in nearly continuous outcrops in arcuate cuestas overlooking the eastern margin of exposed Precambrian basement rocks. These rocks stretch for 1200 km from Beni Khatma in the south (Lat. 18°00′N) to the studied area in Al Qasim Province (Lat. 28°10′N) ( Fig. 1 ). The Permian sequence in Saudi Arabia was named the Khuff Formation by Steineke and Bramkamp (1952) , but the formal designation of its type section was made by Steineke et al. (1958) . Powers et al. (1966) divided the Khuff Formation north of latitude 24°00′N, into three members, the Khuff, Midhnab and Khartam Members. Of these the lower and upper members consist mainly of carbonates and the middle member is composed of shale. Delfour et al. (1982) later divided the Khuff Member into two additional members, the Haqayl and Duhaysan Members. Al Aswad and Kamel (1992) who studied the microfossils in the Khuff Formation south of latitude 30°00′N, recognized foraminifera, calcareous algae and ostracodes that indicate an Upper Permian age for the Khuff Formation. Basyoni (1984) studied the general stratigraphy and sedimentology of the northern outcrop of the Khuff Formation. Al Jallal (1987) described the diagenetic effects on the reservoir rocks of the Khuff Formation and divided the Khuff Formation in the subsurface into four informal members: Khalifa (1993) , in the central part of Saudi Arabia in Al Qasim Province, divided the Khuff Formation of Powers et al. (1966) , into two formations, the lower Sark Formation and the upper Al Watah Formation. Al Aswad (1997) studied the stratigraphy and the cyclicity of the Khuff carbonates. In the present study the Haqayl and Duhaysan members of Delfour et al. (1982) which form the basal part of the Khuff cannot be distinguished. Hence, the author has informally defined the sequence between the Unyzah Formation below and the Midhnab Member above as the ‘Lower Member’ of the Khuff Formation. The Lower Member extends in a northwest-southeast direction along the western margin of the Arabian Basin, forming a prominent 20–40 m high west-facing scarp, with a back slope eroded into a series of well-developed strike ridges ( Fig. 2 ). The Lower Member consists of intercalations of carbonates, marls and claystones at Jal Al Watah and south of Unayzah in the northwest, and pure carbonates at Al Murabba in the southeast ( Fig. 3 ). South of latitude 24°00′N the distinction of this member from the other two overlying members (Midhnab and Khartam members) becomes less clear, as the shale is completely replaced by limestone and there is extensive dolomitization along the entire section. South of latitude 23°00′N, sandstone facies become dominant in the section. In the studied area (Al Qasim Province), the lower member ranges in thickness from 110 m at Al Murabba, 125 m south of Unayzah and 95 m at Jal Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ). The objectives of this paper are: (1) to describe and interpret the different lithofacies using both field data and petrographic microscope observations; (2) to analyze the observed carbonate and siliciclastic rocks into shallowing upward cycles and to interpret the causes reponsible for their generation; and (3) to estimate the timing of diagenetic processes associated with cycles using petrographic investigations. 2. Geological setting The Arabian Plate comprises three main geotectonic provinces, the Arabian Shield, the Arabian Shelf and the mobile Shelf ( Henson, 1951 and Powers et al., 1966 ). The Arabian Shield exposes vast regions of complex igneous and metamorphic rocks of Precambrian age, and occupies about one third of the western and central parts of the Arabian Plate ( Fig. 1 ). Sequences of continental and shallow marine sediments cover the Arabian Shelf that lies north and northeast of the shield. This shelf can be divided into three distinct structural areas; interior homocline, interior platform and several basins ( Powers et al., 1966 ). The mobile belt which lies to the north and east of the shelf includes the Zagros and Oman Mountains and narrow foreland areas that contain the major oil fields of southwestern Iran, northern Iraq and parts of Oman ( Alsharhan and Kendall, 1986 ). In the interior homocline province several structures have been recognized recently by Al Laboun (1986) , including the Hail-Rutbah Arch, the Tabuk and Widyan basins, and the Central Arabian Graben and Trough System ( Fig. 1 ). The studied area lies within the interior homocline near the center of Saudi Arabia ( Fig. 1 ). The Lower Member of the Khuff Formation was deposited after a period of extensive erosion, and overlies older formations that range from Carboniferous in the north to the Precambrian igneous rocks in the south, where erosion become deepest. In the central and northern parts of Saudi Arabia, the Lower Member overlies the Permo-Carboniferous Unayzah Formation ( Al Laboun, 1986 ) and is in turn conformably overlain by the Upper Permian Midhnab Shale (middle member of the Khuff Formation). Southeast of the study area, along the crest of the central Arabian Arch at latitude 23°00′N, the lower member overlies Precambrian basement rocks unconformably. This arch structure was developed initially during the Early Devonian-Late Permian ( Powers et al., 1966 ) or during the Hercynian Orogeny, because the older succession (Early and Late Paleozoic) which covered the basement rocks was completely eroded. The Lower Member was deposited on a stable shelf or interior homocline, defining an area of tectonic stability, with the carbonate cycles exhibiting a remarkably constant dip towards the northeast. 3. Method of study Three stratigraphic sections of the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation were measured at Al Murabba, south of Unayzah and Jal Al Watah in Al Qasim Province ( Fig. 3 ). In each section depositional cycles were identified, based on field observations and petrographic investigations ( Fig. 3 ). The lithological terminology of Dunham (1962) was used. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the diagenetic features of 10 samples taken from the base (laminated lime mudstone), middle (burrowed dolostone) and top of each cycle (lithoclastic grainstone and caliche). XRD and SEM analyses were carried out at the Technical University in Berlin. 4. Lithofacies and interpretation The Lower Member comprises seven carbonate and two siliciclastic lithofacies. These are laminated lime-mudstone, ostracode wackestone, foraminiferal wackestone, interclastic wackestone, burrowed dolostone, lithoclastic grainstone, caliche, quartzarenite and claystone. 4.1. Laminated lime-mudstone This lithofacies commonly occurs at the base of the cycles south of Unayzah and Jal Al Watah. The rock is yellowish white in colour, thinly laminated and ranges in thickness from 2 to 10 m. It consists of equigranular microspar and some bioclasts of unidentified shell debris. Most of the recrystallized shell fragments are arranged parallel to the bedding planes. SEM study shows that the rock comprises equigranular microspar with associated clay minerals, such as smectite ( Fig. 4 A). Interpretation . The microspar was originally deposited as micrite with associated clay minerals, as well as the rare skeletal particles, suggesting that this lithofacies was deposited in a subtidal or low ramp environment below wave base ( Calvet and Tucker, 1988 ). Within argillite layers the skeletal material lies parallel to the bedding suggesting slow sedimentation rates ( Elrick and Read, 1991 ). This facies is devoid of indigenous benthonic fauna or burrows which suggest anoxic conditions during deposition ( Marquis and Laury, 1989 ). The absence of wave and current-induced structures suggests a subtidal environment below storm wave base ( Keller, 1997 ). 4.2. Foraminiferal wackestone Foraminiferal wackestone, with a thickness ranging from 5 to 15 m, forms the base of most cycles at Al Murabba ( Fig. 2 ). The rock is fine-grained, hard, massive and creamy to yellow in colour, containing foraminiferal tests, calcareous algae and ostracode. Most of the foraminiferal tests have been recrystallized with the remainder being micritized. Lime intraclasts are rarely recorded. The binding material is fine-grained lime mud with some black spots of organic matter. Some parts have been subjected to aggrading neomorphism. SEM investigation shows that the lime mud consists of equigranular calcite crystals ( Fig. 4 B). Some crystals are coated with fibrous silica. Interpretation . This lithofacies dominates the area southwestwards towards Al Murabba and has not been recorded northwestwards at Unayzah or Al Watah. This lithofacies was deposited in deeper subtidal conditions. The presence of mud-supported texture, and the apparent absence of wave and current structures, suggests that this facies was deposited in a low energy environment below normal wave base ( Calvet and Tucker, 1988 ). The faunal diversity indicates a stable open marine environment at moderate depth, characterized by the accumulation of foraminifera and algae ( Marquis and Laury, 1989 ). The presence of lime mud intraclasts indicates local bioturbation by burrowing organisms ( Riding and Wright, 1981 ). 4.3. Ostracode wackestone Ostracode wackestone constitutes the basal part of cycles in the middle of the lower member at Unayzah and Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ). It is yellow to creamy in colour, hard and massive. Some Zoophycos burrows, filled with dark lime to clayey lime mudstone, are also recorded. The rock consists of ostracode particles, dasycladacean algae and some calcispheres. Some of these particles were subjected to aggrading neomorphism. Most of the ostracode particles have been filled with lime mud, while ostracode valves are fragmented and even micritized ( Fig. 4 C). The binding material is dense lime-mud that contains iron oxide pigments, some parts of which were replaced by sparry calcite, especially in and around fissures and cracks. Interpretation . This lithofaces is not recorded in the southern part of the studied area. This indicates a relatively shallow subtidal environment in the north due to the Hail-Rutbah Arch. Faunal diversity is low and normal marine fauna are lacking, except for ostracode shells, calcipheres and dasycladacean algae, which indicate quiet, sheltered conditions such as a lagoonal environment ( Khalifa and Zaghloul, 1990 ). Zoophycos burrows indicate deep subtidal conditions. Similar facies elsewhere in the geological record have been interpreted as low energy sub-wave base deposits ( Markello and Read, 1981 ). 4.4. Intraclastic wackestone This lithofacies forms the top of most cycles in the lower and middle parts of the Lower Member at Al Murabba, as well as some cycles at Jal Al Watah and south of Unayzah ( Fig. 3 ). It usually overlies both the foraminiferal and ostracode wackestone. The rock is dark yellow in colour and consists of micrite to microspar with an appreciable amount of poorly sorted intraclasts. The micrite constitutes the groundmass of the rock, and contains dark spots which may be organic matter. Most of this micrite is changed to granular microspar. The intraclasts are variable in shape (spherical and elongated) and range in size from fine to medium-grained. They consist of dense, dark, lime mud, displaying sharp contacts against the lime mud matrix ( Fig. 4 D). Some intraclasts contain fragments of ostracode valves and occasional benthonic foraminifera (e.g. miliolids). Others contain clear calcite patches, few of which have been changed to microspar. Interpretation . The intraclasts in this lithofacies were most probably derived from the underlying ostracode and foraminiferal wackestones. This is evidenced by: (1) the presence of ostracode and miliolid fragments within the intraclasts ( Fig. 7 ); (2) their irregular outlines, denoting that they were ripped up from lithified lime mud; and (3) some degree of poor sorting, suggesting the activity of storms or currents in the intertidal zone or middle ramp setting. However, the presence of miliolid and ostracode particles suggests a restricted lagoonal environment ( Bein, 1977 ). These intraclasts may be formed by wave-generated currents that probably caused transport and dispersal of coarse carbonate clasts over the inner shelf ( Grotzinger, 1986 ). 4.5. Burrowed dolostone The burrowed dolostone always occurs at the top of the cycles, above the laminated lime mudstone and claystone, and sometimes underlies the lithoclastic grainstone ( Fig. 3 ). Rocks of this lithofacies are commonly dark grey in colour and massive, containing small vertical burrows ( Skolithos ) ( Fig. 4 E) filled with brown red clay materials. Petrographic study shows that these rocks comprise fine-grained dolomite, with some intraclasts. Dolomite rhombs are very fine-grained (10–20 μm) and are idiotopic to hypidiotopic with an equigranular fabric ( Fig. 4 F). Some intraclasts are either micritized particles or lime mud fragments that resisted dolomitization. Burrows are variable in size, filled with reddish or black matter and limpid dolomite rhombs. In some burrows, blocky calcite replaces dolomite rhombs due to dedolomitization. Some of these calcite crystals have been dissolved leaving pores. Interpretation . The fine-grained burrowed dolostone may also have been formed in the intertidal or supratidal zones, as indicated by vertical burrows. The paucity of skeletal particles indicates a restricted circulation or high salinities; although there was infaunal burrowing that obliterates most primary structures ( Elrick and Read, 1991 ). The presence of reddish material filling the vertical burrows indicates that these rocks were probably subjected to intermittent subaerial exposure, during which the reddish material could have been deposited by wind. The fine-grained dolomite probably resulted from the early dolomitization of former lime-mud ( Al-Aasm and Packard, 2000 ). This took place in an intertidal to supratidal environment by evaporation in shallow ponds. The evaporation of seawater raised the concentration of Mg ions to the level needed for dolomitization. 4.6. Lithoclastic grainstone Lithoclastic grainstone is an important lithofacies in the Lower Member, because it caps most cycles in the northwestern part of the oucrop south of Unayzah and at Jal Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ). This rock is pink to yellow and contains elongated lithoclasts, usually arranged parallel to the bedding planes, but occasionally showing a random orientation. This lithofacies always overlies the burrowed dolostone and underlies the laminated lime mudstone of the subsequent cycle. Thicknesses range typically from 20 to 40 cm. In thin section, the rock consists of dolomite and lime mud. Dolomite lithoclasts predominate, being medium to coarse-grained, well-rounded, dark grey to black in colour and cemented by iron oxides. Lime mudstone lithoclasts are light grey in colour, abundant and coarser in size than the dolomite lithoclasts ( Fig. 5 A). Lime-mud lithoclasts are cracked and altered to sparry calcite because of aggrading neomorphism. This is evidenced by the gradational contact between lithoclasts and the sparry calcite cement. Also, some of the lithoclasts were partially or completely altered to sparry calcite ( Fig. 5 B). Both types of lithoclasts are cemented by sparry calcite, which is usually stained with iron oxide. Interpretation . This lithofacies consists only of dolomitic and lime mud lithoclasts, suggesting that they were ripped up from the underlying burrowed dolostone and laminated lime mudstone, in the basal part of the cycles. These lithoclasts represent extraclasts brought into the site of deposition from an outside source. This is evidenced by the iron oxide coating, recrystallized veinlets and greater neomorphism, indicating subaerial exposure ( Flugel, 1982 ). This argument of iron oxides rimming lithoclasts as evidence for subaerial exposure was suggested by Marquis and Laury (1989) for the deposition of algal collapse-brecciated limestone in the Geon Limestone Cyclothem (Desmoinesian), Concho Platform, Central Texas. 4.7. Caliche Caliche deposits occur between some cycles in the Lower Member at Unayzah and Jal Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ). They are reddish to brown in colour, porous and vary from 10 to 20 cm in thickness and cap the dolostone ( Fig. 5 C). In thin section, caliche consists of micrite layers containing some root traces. These appear as cylindrical or conical moulds, usually representing complex geopetal infillings of sparry calcite of fresh water diagenetic origin ( Fig. 5 D). Scanning electron microscope study showed that the micritic layers consist of dark-grey micronodules. Chievelet and Gimenez (1992) described the micronodules as globules which are characteristic features in soils. The origin of micronodules could be due to the concentration of some components (e.g. carbonate enriched with iron) within incompletely consolidated micritic sediments ( James, 1972 ). Otherwise, they could reflect biological activity regarded as the principal process for the formation of nodules ( Chievelet and Gimenez, 1992 ). White patches in the caliche represent micron-sized calcite which coalesces to produce coarser calcite crystals. Interpretation . Caliche deposits are recognised by micronodulation, root traces and fresh water carbonate cements. They were probably formed by degradation processes (dissolution of pre-existing carbonates) in situ or were precipitated from fresh water enriched in carbonates ( Somerville, 1979 ). In general, caliche development results from a complex combination of climate, relief, vegetation, parent material and time. This development was directly related to a relative lowering of sea-level and active subaerial exposure at intervals during the deposition of the Lower Member. Caliche has been recorded in the upper part of shallowing-upward cycles in the lower Bringantian Limestone of North Wales ( Somerville, 1979 ), in Pleistocene and Holocene deposits in Barbados ( James, 1972 ), and in the upper part of regressive carbonate shelf cycles in the lower Pennsylvanian Black Prince Limestone in southern Arizona ( Goldhammer et al., 1987 ). 4.8. Calcareous quartzarenite This lithofacies forms the upper part of the lower member at Jal Al Watah. It has a thickness of 12 m. The rock is yellowish white in colour and shows cross-lamination, e.g. flaser bedding, plane lamination and herringbone structure and contains leaves and wood stems. In thin section, the rock is made of quartz (90%) of medium to coarse, well rounded and poorly to fairly sorted grains. Most of the grains show a uniform extinction. A few grains exhibit slightly undulose extinction and are of semicomposite type. Some silica overgrowths, representing early cement, envelop the grains, while the dominant cement is microcrystalline calcite that replaces the silica overgrowths and even the borders of quartz grains. Interpretation . Well-sorted quartzarenite at the top of the Lower Member, only in the Al Watah section, indicate that channels occurred locally on the shelf, through which the detrital grains were transported from uplifted areas in the hinterland to the northwest. Associated primary structures such as flaser bedding and herringbone cross bedding indicate that the quartzarenite was deposited in intertidal or possibly a foreshore environment ( Elrick and Read, 1991 ). The presence of plant remains suggests a near shore facies. Similar facies were described and interpreted by Klein (1970) as deposited during a regressive phase, characterized by shallow marine tidal deposits. 4.9. Claystone The claystone lithofacies always occurs at the base of cycles in different levels in the Lower Member. Claystones vary in thickness from one cycle to another (2–10 m) and are grey to yellow in colour, calcareous with associated sponge spicules and other shell debris. XRD analyses of some samples show that the dominant clay minerals at Al Murabba and south of Unayzah are illite and smectite, whereas at Al Watah kaolinite occurs with smectite. Interpretation . The clayey facies are devoid of benthonic forminifera suggesting deposition in an anoxic environment. The presence of sponge spicules is characteristic of Upper Paleozoic deeper water from lower ramp or outer subtidal settings ( Wilson, 1975 ). The deposition of the claystone on the shelf may be controlled by climatic conditions. During humid condition, detrital clays are dominant, while in a dry climate clays decrease and carbonate increases ( Lakew, 1990 ). This interpretation may explain the cyclic sequence of clays at the base and carbonate at the top of cycles. 5. Diagenesis The diagenetic history of the lower member of the Khuff Formation was controlled largely by water chemistry as a result of eustatic sea level changes, in conjunction with changing climatic conditions. Post-depositional diagenetic changes are interpreted to have occurred primarily in marine and freshwater phreatic environments ( Harris et al., 1997 ). The main diagenetic processes in marine phreatic environments are: (1) cementation, micritization, and silicification in the basal part of cycles (subtidal zone); (2) dolomitization and cementation in the middle part of cycles (intertidal zone); and (3) pore-filling cement, aggrading neomorphism, dedolomitization and gypsum-carbonate replacement in the tops of cycles (supratidal and subaerial zone). 5.1. Subtidal diagenesis (lower part of cycle) In the deep subtidal zone, the main diagenetic change occurs in the marine phreatic environment and includes cementation, micritization, and the deposition of silica. 5.1.1. Cementation In the subtidal zone or lower ramp setting cementation occurs commonly by the precipitation of micrite in intergranular and intragranular pores which reduces porosity. Microbial and other sediment comminution processes may have participated in the generation of micrite ( Fig. 5 E). Micrite cementation occurs in the wackestones and laminated lime mudstone lithofacies. The cement in tropical shallow marine sediments is composed of aragonite (acicular crystals) and high magnesium calcite of peloidal fabric which are subsequently changed to calcite ( Tucker, 1992 ). Low Mg calcite crystals in the subtidal lithofacies were either directly precipitated from seawater as micrite, or have replaced the originally deposited aragonite and high Mg-calcite. Rare isopachous Mg-calcite cement occurs rimming skeletal allochems ( Harris et al., 1997 ). 5.1.2. Micritization Micritization or degrading recrystallization is the process by which skeletal and non-skeletal particles undergo alteration and destruction into micrite patches, where neither chambers nor test walls are recognizable. This phenomenon was described by Bathurst, 1971 , Perkins and Halsey, 1971 , Alexanderson, 1972 and Kobluk and Risk, 1977 . In the present study micritization is represented by two processes: first is partial micritization, where the chambers of the skeletal particles are micritized by the effects of endolithic algae and fungi. ( Fig. 5 F); second is the complete transformation of the skeletal particles into peloids or amorphous grains. This process may be responsible for the formation of the micritized lithoclasts that build by themselves the lithoclastic grainstone lithofaces. Micritization is a common process in this zone and can be formed by three types of endolithic organism, fungi, green algae and distinctive siphonaceous green algae ( Perkins and Halsey, 1971 ). 5.1.3. Silicification In the deep subtidal zone, silicification is predominant, where calcite crystals are frequently coated with fibrous silica (chalcedony) in laminated lime-mudstone ( Fig. 6 A). SEM study reveals the presence of some sponge tests in the wackestones. It is probably that the formation of fibrous silica is related to the dissolution of such sponge spicules. The source of the silica was probably dissolution of biogeneic opal-A form sponge spicules and diatom valves as proposed by Harris et al. (1997) for similar sediments in the Atlantic Coastal Plain. 5.2. Intertidal diagenesis (middle part of cycle) In the intertidal zone, where the water is shallow and warmer than in the subtidal zone, evaporation is common, leading to the increase of the Mg/Ca ratio needed for dolomitization ( Folk and Land, 1975 ). Dolomitization is the predominant diagenetic process in this zone. In certain beds, below the top of the cycle (lithoclastic grainstone) and above the wackestones or the laminated lime mudstones, it is probable that dolomitization occurred during the early stages of diagenesis. Selective dolomitization could be related to the lowering of sea-level and the promotion of evaporation. Climate is another important factor in the promotion of dolomitization ( Tucker, 1992 ). An arid climate is necessary for supratidal evaporite and reflux dolomitization, while a humid climate is more likely to promote mixing meteoric-saline dolomitization. The dolostone facies always occurs at the top of the shallowing upward cycles or para-sequences in most of the studied sections, and can aid the understanding of the sequence stratigraphy, especially in carbonate successions ( Vail et al., 1977 and Van Wagoner et al., 1988 ). Hence, the distribution and abundance in this study of cycles capped by dolostone suggests a fluctuation in sea-level during sedimentation. In this respect, similar carbonate cycles capped by dolostones were recorded in a carbonate platform sequence in the Middle Ordovician of Korea ( Yoo and Lee, 1998 ). 5.3. Supratidal and subaerial diagenesis (upper cycle) When the sea withdraws subaerial diagenesis occurs in a fresh-water phreatic environment. This can be recognised in the peritidal cycles capped by lithoclastic grainstone, and caliche, which form the top of cycles at Jal Al Watah and south of Unayzah ( Fig. 3 ). Diagenetic effects are: (1) precipitation of pore-filling low-Mg calcite, ferroan-calcite cement; (2) aggrading neomorphism: of micrite to micro spar and granular calcite; (3) dedolomitization; and (4) evaporite-calcite-dolomite replacement. 5.3.1. Precipitation of cement Ferroan calcite crystals in the cement are usually equant, having a length/width ratio of 2:1 to 1:1 and are reddish in colour due to contamination by iron oxides. This type of cement may represent a late stage of cementation in the vadose or meteoric zone ( Fig. 6 B). This type of cement occurs in the upper part of transgressive lag deposits at TST (Transgressive Systems Tract) parasequence boundaries ( Ketzer et al., 2002 ). Based on the following criteria it is inferred to have been precipitated as low Mg-calcite from meteoric pore water: (1) The cement contains an appreciable amount of iron oxides, which may be derived from subaerially exposed continental facies; (2) The cement is always associated with reworked lithoclasts derived from the underlying and adjacent lithofacies; (3) The ferroan calcite which fills the pore spaces in cycle tops was deposited in the vadose zone, similar to the Middle Triassic carbonate platform of northern Italy ( Goldhammer et al., 1987 ); (4) The calcite cement shows a sharp contact with the two types of lithoclasts ( Fig. 5 B); and (5) SEM images show that the lithoclastic grainstone consists of two different lithoclasts: a white component consisting of smectite and microspar, probably derived from the laminated lime mudstone lithofacies; and columnar fresh water calcite. 5.3.2. Dedolomitization The dedolomitization process is the replacement of dolomite by blocky calcite, and has transformed dolomite lithoclasts derived from the underlying burrowed dolostone into blocky calcite. The clear calcite crystals filling pore spaces are larger than the ferroan calcite cement (550–800 μm) ( Fig. 6 C). The dedolomitization process usually occurs in the subaerial zone due to the effect of percolation of meteoric water on dolostones ( Chaftez, 1972 ). The percolation may lead to the removal of the Mg ions that prevent the enlargement of calcite crystals. So the replaced calcite from dolostones has blocky extensions. This has been observed by many authors ( James, 1972 and Khalifa and Abu El-Hasan, 1993 ). As the dedolomitization process takes place in the subaerial zone it can be used to recognise sea level fall and sequence boundaries ( Khalifa et al., 2003 ). 5.3.3. Aggrading neomorphism This process is common in the topmost parts of cycles where it affects both ferroan calcite cement and the derived lithoclasts. Coarsening of calcite crystals may result from the leaching of Mg ions from the lime mud, since its presence in the lime-mud prevents the enlargement of the calcite ( Folk, 1974 ). Different forms can be produced according to the progress of neomorphism. If the neomorphism starts from center towards the margin in the peloids, this produces granular calcite enveloped by a rind of micrite called a micrite envelope ( Fig. 6 B); when neomorphism starts from the outer borders the calcite diminishes in size towards the center. The main factors controlling the progress of aggrading neomorphism are the presence of Mg ions, fresh meteoric water, and clay minerals. Fresh water is capable of leaching Mg ions from the micrite, as evidenced by the coarser calcite grains occurring in and/or near fissures and cracks; away from fractures grain size gradually decreases. The presence of Mg ions minimizes the size of the calcite crystals, and the absence of Mg-ions maximizes the size of calcite crystals ( Folk, 1974 ). Clay minerals in micrite cause the growth of calcite laths (elongated calcite spar), found in the Paleocene Esna Shale in the Farafra Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt ( Khalifa and Zaghloul, 1986 ). Clay in micrite causes removal of Mg because clay particles absorb Mg ions expelled from micrite during diagenesis ( Longman, 1977 ). 5.3.4. Replacement of calcite and dolomite by gypsum The replacement of calcite and dolomite by evaporites is common in the subaerial zone, usually associated with the dedolomitization process. A similar process was found in the uppermost cycles in the Lower Miocene Um Mahara Formation, Ras Banas, Red Sea Coast ( Khalifa et al., 2003 ). Percolation of meteoric water dissolves dolomite with the concurrent precipitation of gypsum. At a later stage, gypsum may be dissolved by fresh water percolating through the rock, leaving pores in carbonate rocks. SEM studies on samples of lithoclastic grainstone (uppermost cycle) show that the evaporite minerals replace calcite grains ( Fig. 6 D). The discussion of the subaerial diagenesis of carbonate rocks, either limestone or dolostone, provides valuable information about the vertical recurrence of cycles. This means that the cyclic sedimentation was not continuous, but there were periods of non-deposition during which subaerial diagenesis could take place. This can be explained by variation in sea level during sedimentation. Thus, subaerial diagenesis may assist the recognition of sequence stratigraphy, and may define sequence boundaries. 6. Depositional cycles Detailed stratigraphic and petrographic studies of the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation have revealed a marked cyclicity ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 7 ). Cycles showing a shallowing upward trend vary from 3 to 15 m in thickness. This marked variation in cycle thickness, either vertically or laterally, probably reflects changes in rates of subsidence and sediment supply. Peritidal as well as subtidal cycles have been recognized. The discrimination of cycles is dependent on the number of superimposed subenvironments. The peritidal cycle represents a wide vertical range of subenvironments, starting with subtidal and ending with supratidal or subaerial sub-environments. These are termed complete cycles ( Fig. 7 A). Subtidal cycles represent a narrower range of sub-environments (subtidal and intertidal) ( Fig. 7 B), i.e. they represent incomplete shoaling relative to sea-level and are termed incomplete cycles. Fig. 8 is a schematic diagram illustrating the possible origins of the complete and incomplete cycles. In the peritidal and subtidal cycles, clay content decreases upward; also, there is an increase in the calcium carbonate content and an increase in the degree of dolomitization in the middle, and complete dolomitization toward the tops of the cycles. There are two types of peritidal cycles in the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation. The first comprises subtidal, laminated, lime mudstone at the base, overlain by burrowed dolostone, supratidal lithoclastic grainstone and caliche deposits at the top ( Fig. 7 A-1). The second consists of subtidal claystone at the base, followed by intertidal burrowed dolostone and capped by supratidal lithoclastic grainstone ( Fig. 7 A-2). The contact between these lithofacies is usually gradational, while the upper contact with the overlying cycle is mostly sharp. These cycles occur only south of Unayzah and Jal Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ). The subtidal cycles consist only of two sub-environments, starting with deep subtidal deposits and capped by shallow subtidal to intertidal deposits. Four types of subtidal cycles are recognized in this study ( Fig. 7 B): (1) The first type consists of subtidal foraminiferal wackestone at the base, capped by shallow subtidal intraclastic wackestone at the top ( Fig. 7 B-1). Such cycles constitute the lower two-thirds of the Lower Member at Al Murabba; (2) The second type begins with subtidal laminated lime mudstone, capped by intertidal burrowed dolostone ( Fig. 7 B-2). This type is common south of Unayzah and Jal Al Watah; (3) The third type of subtidal cycles consists of shallow subtidal ostracode wackestone at the base, capped by shallow subtidal intraclastic wackestone ( Fig. 7 B-3). These occur in places south of Unayzah and Jal Al Watah; and (4) The fourth type consists of subtidal claystone at the base, overlain by intertidal burrowed dolostone ( Fig. 7 B-4). This type occurs rarely at Al Murabba, but is more common at Jal Al Awath ( Fig. 3 ). 7. Mechanism of cyclicity and discussion At the end of the Carboniferous period, movements associated with the Hercynian epirogeny took place all over Saudi Arabia. The associated erosion removed the Carboniferous sediments in the north, and subsequently older sediments of the Lower Paleozoic clastic facies were removed. When the Permian sediments were deposited they lay unconformably on Precambrian basement rocks of the Central Arabian Arch (south of latitude 24°00′N). During the Upper Permian the Arabian Peninsula was invaded by the sea, which deposited carbonate rocks, blanketting the entire region. Continued subsidence and sedimentation occurred, resulting in the deposition of the Permo-Triassic Sudair Shale. However, the occurrence of positive structures crossing the stable shelf zone, e.g. the Hail-Rutbah Arch in the northwest of the studied area ( Fig. 1 ), resulted in facies changes during sedimentation. Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain metre-scale shallowing-upward cycles in the geological record. The most important of these hypotheses are the autocyclic, the allocyclic, and the Milankovitch orbital forcing theory. 7.1. Autocyclic The autocyclic mechanism does not require changes in sea level, but is controlled primarily by processes taking place within a basin, or in part of the basin ( Ginsburg, 1971 , Wilkinson, 1982 and James, 1984 ). The autocyclic mechanism is dependent upon the periodic progradation of tidal flats seaward. During progradation, the open marine source area for the carbonate decreases in size, carbonate production slows down, and sediment accumulation is outpaced by continued subsidence. As water depth increases, the carbonate source area expands, and a new cycle commences. The autocyclic mechanism has a limited range in generation of subtidal cycles and can be used to explain stratigraphic noise within a limited area, but it cannot control the development of regional repetitive subtidal carbonate cycles ( Osleger, 1991 ). Moreover, it cannot explain the vadose diagenesis in the upper parts of the peritidal cycles ( Osleger, 1991 and Osleger and Read, 1991 ). 7.2. Milankovitch's orbital forcing theory The Milankovich forcing theory has been used by some authors to explain thin carbonate cycles in the Triassic sequence of northern Italy ( Goldhammer et al., 1987 ). But this theory was dismissed by Algeo and Wilkinson (1988) as they recognised difficulties in the application of orbital forcing theory to carbonate cycles. Because the Milankovitch theory assumes: (1) A relatively complete stratigraphic record; (2) Periodic (non-random) cycle deposition; (3) One sedimentary cycle is deposited for each sea level rise; (4) In glacial times, the amplitude of these oscillations is high, perhaps up to 150 m, but in non-glacial times the amplitude will probably be less than 10 m. All of these assumptions are untenable for the Upper Permian carbonate cycles in Saudi Arabia, especially for the eustatic sea level changes, because of the difference in thicknesses, and the number of lithofacies in both subtidal and peritidal cycles. 7.3. Allocyclic The allocyclic mechanism invokes changes in relative sea-level caused by: (1) Eustatic fluctuations of sea level; (2) Changes in relative sea level due to intrabasinal tectonic activity (e.g. differential subsidence, faulting) ( Grotzinger, 1986 , Hardie and Shinn, 1986 , Hardie et al., 1986 and Cisne, 1986 ). Allocyclic processes which cause a fall in sea-level result in subaerial exposure of the platform, permitting varying degrees of vadose diagenesis ( Grotzinger, 1986 ). This process is suitable for the formation of the subtidal and peritidal cycles recorded in the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation. In the present study, two types of cycles are recognized in the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation: subtidal cycles (incomplete cycles); and peritidal cycles (complete cycles). Subtidal cycles are dominant at Al Murabba in the southeastern portion of the study area, and a few of them intercalated with peritidal cycles, both south of Unayzah and at Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ). These subtidal cycles differ from peritidal cycles in that: (1) They do not shoal into the supratidal zone, but remain submerged throughout their depositional history ( Osleger, 1991 ); (2) They usually consist of two lithofaces ( Fig. 7 B); (3) They are not capped by the supratidal lithofaces, e.g. lithoclastic grainstone and caliche; and (4) No subtidal cycles exhibit surface exposure marked by vadose diagenesis and brecciation. These cycles may represent incomplete filling of the accommodation space created during sedimentation. The first type of subtidal cycle ( Fig. 7 B-1) is dominant in the section at Al Murabba. These subtidal cycles may be attributed to internal factors within the basin of deposition. These factors are carbonate production, changes in water circulation, salinity, depth, chemistry, energy, temperature and nutrient content ( Strasser et al., 1999 ). These factors become important in the formation of the subtidal cycles, whose relative thickness is in part controlled by sediment production, rather than by accommodation space alone. Normal salinity, nutrient content and temperature are important factors in the production of carbonate sediments, and can lead to a rate of carbonate production greater than the subsidence rate. However, the subtidal carbonate (foraminiferal wackestones, and intraclastic wackestone) cycles did not shoal up into the intertidal zone because other factors, such as constant submarine erosion, wave currents and redistribution, tended to inhibit aggradation above the level reworked by active storm-waves. Facies composing the cycles consist of deep subtidal foraminiferal wackestone (open marine) overprinted by lagoonal facies, e.g. intraclastic wackestone (restricted lagoon). The composition of these cycles (ten cycles) are closely similar but cannot be correlated laterally, suggesting that they were formed in certain restricted environments constrained by internal factors. Other types of subtidal and/or incomplete cycles ( Fig. 7 B-3 and B-4) are intercalated with complete and/or peritidal cycles south of Unyzah and at Jal Al Watah ( Fig. 3 ), and may be affected by sea level changes, since they are capped by intertidal burrowed dolostone. During slight falls in sea level the intertidal zone becomes dominant, where burrowing by animals, e.g. Skolithos (vertical burrows) is possible. In addition, in this zone Mg ions increase, permitting the dolomitization of formerly deposited lime-mud ( Mossler, 1971 ). In the early stages of passive margin evolution ( Grotzinger, 1986 ), or in differentially subsiding intracratonic basins ( Aigner, 1985 ), intrabasin tectonics can have an important control on cyclicity in carbonates. Eustatic sea level changes or intrabasinal tectonics (differential subsidence and faulting) may be the cause of complete and/or peritidial cyclicity in the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation. These processes might provide accommodation space to permit the accumulation of more than two or three shallowing-upward lithofacies; this would mean that the accommodation space was completely filled up, from the deep subtidal to the subaerial zone. (1) Peritidal cycles that consist of 3–4 lithofacies show the effects of rapid transgression at the base, due to differential subsidence, overlain by lithofacies indicating a slow fall in sea-level. Rapid transgression results in the deposition of deep subtidal claystone, or laminated lime mudstone, with no underlying lag deposits. Goodwin and Anderson (1985) suggested that the absence of lag deposits at the bases of cycles indicated an abrupt increase in water depth, or a ‘punctuation event’. The upper slow regression led to the deposition of three lithofacies, represented by the intertidal burrowed dolostone, the supratidal lithoclastic grainstone and the subaerial caliche. (2) Sea level fall may lead to deep leaching and grain dissolution ( Tucker, 1992 ) giving rise to brecciation and development of lithoclastic grainstone, and even the deposition of caliche. (3) Sea-level fall can account for diagenesis by active meteoric water, e.g. dedolomitization, aggrading neomorphism and evaporite-calcite replacement ( Fig. 9 ). (4) Tectonic movements that caused the uplift of the Hail-Rutbah High, lies to the northwest of the studied localities, was active during the Late Paleozoic ( Powers et al., 1966 ). This movement gave rise to changes in the facies of the Lower Khuff Formation from carbonate and mixed clastic-carbonate to entirely clastic above and around the Hail-Rutbah High. A thick sandstone sequence (12 m calcareous quartzarenite) at the top of the sequence at Jal Al Watah indicates general shallowing, or emergence, adjacent to the Hail-Rutbah High. This is in harmony with the interpretation of Wilson (1975) , who suggested that widespread cyclicity in the Late Paleozoic may be attributable to eustatic sea-level changes, enhanced by local tectonics, causing unstable shelves and the periodic influx of terrigenous clastics, shutting down carbonate production. Peritidal cycles commencing with the deposition of claystone at the base, capped by burrowed dolostones and lithoclastic grainstone, may have been enhanced by a tectonic effect which caused an abrupt transition from shallow water carbonates directly to claystone ( Satterley, 1996 ). Some published models suggest that the claystone in the basal cycles may be deposited during lowstands, while the occurrence of deeper siliciclastic sediments decreases markedly during highstands, when most river-borne detritus is trapped in inner shelf environments and carbonate production is common instead ( Dolan, 1989 ). Thus mixed clastic-carbonate peritidal cycles may be formed intercalated with subtidal cycles at Jal Al Watah and south of Unayzah. In some cycles evaporation increases the Mg/Ca ratio to the level required for dolomitization, with the formation of burrowed dolostone. Dolomitization near the upper parts of cycles has been described from regressive carbonate cycles in the Canet Formation (Middle–Late Triassic), southern Iberian Ranges, Eastern Spain ( Gomez and Mamet, 1990 ), and in the Upper Triassic Calcare di Zu, southern Alps ( Lakew, 1990 ). The above processes gave rise to the formation of third and fourth subtidal cycles intercalated with pertidal cycles south of Unayzah and Jal Al Watah (Fig. 3). During this process caliche deposits could be formed locally, capping some peritidal cycles. This process dominates in carbonate platforms, which are exposed during lowstand sea-levels ( Goldhammer et al., 1990 and Hunt and Tucker, 1992 ). Renewed subsidence or rise in sea-level will cause flooding and transgression and the initiation of a new cycle. The thickness of the caliche capping to peritidal cycles probably depended on the degree of vadose diagenesis, amplitude of oscillation and climatic conditions. Goldhammer et al. (1987) proposed that vadose diagenesis on cycle caps in northern Italy may be formed above sea-level in periods measured in only centuries. Also, the average rate of development of a caliche crust on limestone during Plio-Pleistocene glacio-eustatic sea-level oscillation is about 1 cm/1000 yr ( James, 1972 ). If these conditions prevailed during the deposition of the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation the caliche deposits, 20–30 cm thick, required an exposure of about 2000–3000 yr. The coarse clastic facies (calcareous quartzarenites) at the top of the lower member may have been transported across the emergent platform from the source area in the northwest, where the Rutbah-Hail Arch was active during sedimentation. The sandstones were deposited during a low sea-level stand in a narrow incised valley. During the subsequent transgressive period, with rising base-level the river systems were backed-up, so that the finer clastics (claystones) of the overlying Midhnab Shale Member were deposited on top of the carbonates of the Lower Member of the Khuff Formation. 8. Conclusions The Lower Member of the Khuff Formation (Upper Permian), exposed along the western margin of the Arabian Basin, in Al Qasim Province, Saudia Arabia consists of 5–14-m-thick shallowing-upward cycles with a total thickness of 120 m. Two types of cyclic sequences can be recognized: peritidal and subtidal cycles. The subtidal cycles commence with subtidal facies and capped by either subtidal or intertidal facies. Four types of subtidal cycles were recognized: (1) subtidal foraminiferal wackestone, capped by shallow subtidal intraclastic wackestone; (2) subtidal laminated lime mudstone, capped by burrowed dolostone; (3) subtidal ostracode wackestone, overlain by shallow subtidal intraclastic wackestone; and (4) subtidal claystone and foraminiferal wackestone, capped by intertidal burrowed dolostone. It is suggested that the first type of subtidal cycle was formed at Al Murabba as the result of internal factors, e.g. sea level changes, carbonate production, salinity and temperature, within a restricted basin. The other types of subtidal cycles which are intercalated with the peritidal cycles were probably formed by an allocyclic mechanism. These cycles are termed ‘incomplete cycles’ as they do not involve complete shoaling, or the complete filling of the accommodation space. The peritidal cycles show complete shoaling (from subtidal up to subaerial) and consist of subtidal claystone or laminated lime mudstone, followed by intertidal burrowed dolostone and supratidal lithoclastic grainstone. Caliche deposits cap some cycles. These cycles are present south of Unayzah and at Al Watah, and in the upper part of the Al Murabba section. These cycles may be formed by an allocyclic mechanism as they show the following characteristics: (1) the cycles show a rapid transgression, followed by slow emergence; (2) subaerial diagenesis with extensive brecciation occurs at the top of these cycles. Hence, these cycles are termed ‘complete cycles’ as the accommodation space was completely filled, from the deep subtidal up to the subaerial zone. Diagenetic studies of the depositional cycles show that the main diagenetic features in the basal part of the cycle (subtidal zone) are micritization, micrite cementation and silicification. The middle part (intertidal zone) was subjected to dolomitization, while the upper parts (supratidal-subaerial) were affected by dedolomitization, sparry calcite cementation, aggrading neomorphism and gypsum-calcite replacement.
