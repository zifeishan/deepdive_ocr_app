A

numerical
wind
—
wave
hindcast
is
developed
for
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
based
on
the
20th
century
atmospheric
reanalysis
(
20CR
)
.
Wave
results
are
validated
directly
against
data
originating
from
voluntary
observing
ships
and
satellite
altimetry
in
the
North
—
East
Atlantic
Ocean
.
The
normalized
error
for
yearly
—
mean
signiﬁcant
wave
height
(
H5
)
is
shown
to
be
of
the
order
of
5
%
for
the
second
part
of
the
20th
century
.
An
indirect
validation
is
also
performed
through
10
m
wind
speed
and
suggests
that
the
accuracy
of
yearly
—
mean
H5
only
slightly
decreases
for
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
.
The
comparison
between
H5
and
the
index
of
the
North
Atlantic
Oscillation
revealed
that
this
phenomenon
partly
controls
I-is
inter
—
annual
variability
,
with
a
positive
(
negative
)
correlation
in
the
northeastern
(
southwestern
)
part
of
the
study
area
.
The
analysis
of
model
results
shows
an
increase
in
H5
over
the
whole
North
Atlantic
Ocean
superimposed
to
the
inter
—
annual
variability

This
increase
is
explained
by
a
rise
in
wind
speed
exceeding
20
%
north
of
50

The

Introduction
Ocean
wind
—
waves
are
relevant
for
numerous
engineering
and
scientiﬁc
questions
,
both
in
coastal
zones
and
in
the
deep
ocean
.
Nevertheless
,
the
proper
characterization
of
wave
height
inter
—
annual
variability
and
the
depiction
of
long
—
term
trends
require
long
—
term
times
series
while
wave
data
are
almost
inexistent
prior
to
1950
.
Compared
to
local
measurements
,
wave
height
data
derived
from
satellite
(
Bauer
2001
;
al.
,
2002
)
offers
the
unique
advantage
of
a
global
coverage
.
Thus
,
(
2011
)
found
a
general
global
upward
trend
for
wind
speed
and
signiﬁcant
wave
height
(
I-ls
)
over
the
period
1985-2008
,
this
rate
being
larger
for
the
90th
and
99th
percentiles
.
However
,
the
24-year
covered
period
is
too
short
to
conclude
whether
this
upward
trend
results
from
inter
—
annual
or
interdecadal
variability
or
a
long
term
trend
driven
by
global
change
.
Wave
height
derived
from
Voluntary
Observing
Ships
(
hereafter
VOS
)
was
shown
to
constitute
an
interesting
approach
(
Gulev
al.
,
2003
;
Grigorieva
,
2004
)
,
although
observations
are
restricted
mostly
to
the
main
commercial
routes
and
become
very
scarce
prior
to
1950
.

this

was
partly

(

provides
the
unique
opportunity
to

a

over

.
This
study
presents
the
results
of
a

spanning
from

to

We
developed
a

based
on
the

(
Tolman

,
which

over

(
Fig.

)
originating
from
the
NOAA
OI
SST
V2
reanalysis
(
Reynolds
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
model
was
forced
with
3
—
hourly
wind
ﬁelds
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
V2
(
Compo
al.
,
2011
)
.
This
atmospheric
reanalysis
assimilates
pressure
observation
and
the
data
considered
in
this
study
corresponds
to
the
ensemble
—
mean
data
provided
over
a
1.875
”
>
l
<
1.875
”
grid
.
However
,
20CR
ensemble
—
mean
wind
ﬁelds
are
expected
to
be
too
smooth
in
the
end
of
the
19th
century
(
Wang
al.
,
press
)
,
which
is
a
major
limitation
to
force
a
dynamical
wave
hindcast
.
In
particular
,
extreme
winds
from
the
ensemble
—
mean
were
shown
to
be
low
—
biased
(
Bronnimann
al.
,
2012
)
for
this
period
.
These
limitations
explain
why
this
study
was
restricted
to
the
analysis
of
yearly
—
mean
wave
heights
in
the
20th
century
.
Finally
,
3
—
hourly
time
series
of
wave
heights
were
archived
at
each
grid
node
and
long
—
term
trends
were
computed
using
a
Huber
robust
regression
method
(
Huber
,
1981
)
.
This
analysis
was
restricted
to
an
area
spanning
70
°
W-10
°
E
and
20
°
N
—
70
°
N
(
Fig.

)
,
which
corresponds
to
the
area
where
ﬁeld
observations
were
available
for
validation
.
2.2
.
Validation
of
input
wind
ﬁelds
The
key
issue
when
performing
a
wave
hindcast
over
such
a
long
period
is
the
consistency
of
the
input
wind
ﬁelds
along
the
time
.
In
order
to
verify
the
quality
of
the
20CR
reanalysis
along
the
20th
century
,
we
performed
a
point
—
by
—
point
comparison
with
sea
—
level
pressure
(
SLP
)
and
10
m
wind
speed
(
U10
)
originating
from
VOS
data
reported
in
the
ICOADS
database
(
International
Comprehensive
Ocean
—
Atmosphere
Data
Set
,
al.
,
2011
)
.
This
data
was
not
assimilated
in
the
20CR
and
thereby
allows
for
an
independent
validation
.
An
inter
—
comparison
between
SLP
and
U10
originating
from
the
popular
ERA40
(
2.5
‘’
as
2.5
”
/
6
h
)
and
the
NCEP/NCAR
(
1.875
°
*
1.875
”
/
6
h
)
reanalyzes
was
also
performed
over
the
period
of
ERA40
(
1958-2001
)
.
For
each
year
,
the
root
mean
square
of
the
difference
(
hereafter
RMSD
)
between
modeled
(
20CR
,
NCEP/NCAR
and
ERA40
)
and
observed
(
VOS
)
SLP
and
U10
was
performed
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
(
70
°
W
—
0
°
W
and
20
°
N-70
°
N
,
1
)
.
This
area
includes
a
large
density
of
observations
,
ranging
from
a
few
tens
per
year
in
the
late
19th
century
to
several
hundreds
of
thousands
for
the
last
6
decades
.
This
comparison
reveals
ﬁrstly
a
good
agreement
between
observed
and
modeled
SLP
for
the
three
considered
atmospheric
reanalyzes
,
with
a
root
mean
square
of
the
difference
(
hereafter
RMSD
)
of
the
order
of
2
HPa
from
1950
to
1990
,
decreasing
to
less
than
1.5
HPa
for
the
last
decade
(
Table
1
;
2A
)
.
This
RMSD
increases
by
15
%
for
the
20CR
reanalysis
for
the
ﬁrst
half
of
the
20th
century
,
although
two
orders
of
magnitude
less
observations
were
available
over
the
period
19001920
.
The
comparison
between
observed
and
modeled
Um
for
the
three
selected
reanalyzes
shows
that
RMSD
is
of
the
order
of
3.5
m/s
for
the
period
1950-2010
,
with
a
slight
decrease
over
the
last
decade
(
Table
1
;
2B
)
.
In
more
details
,
ERA40
performs
slightly
better
than
20CR
and
NCEP
,
although
the
comparison
shows
a
larger
negative
bias
of
the
order
of
2.0
m/s
(
Table
1
)
.
Low
—
biased
winds
in
ERA40
were
already
reported
by
(
2011
)
.
RMSD
and
NRMSD
for
U10
originating
from
20CR
only
show
a
10
%
increase
for
the
period
1900-1950
compared
to
the
second
part
of
the
20th
century
.
Finally
,
the
comparison
between
20CR
reanalysis
and
VOS
data
for
the
end
of
the
19th
century
reveals
that
both
SLP
and
U10
have
much
larger
errors

This
large

supports
the

of

.
2.3
.
Validation
of
wave
predictions
In
order
to
validate
wave
model
predictions
,
we
used
wave
height
data
derived
from
VOS
and
processed
by
Gulev
and
Grigorieva
(
2004
)
.
Data
after
1950
provides
separate
estimates
of
wind
sea
and
swell
.
The
corresponding
signiﬁcant
wave
height
(
H5
)
was
computed
as
the
square
root
of
the
sum
of
the
square
of
wind
sea
and
swell
heights
.
This
resulting
wave
height
is
thus
consistent
with
the
spectral
H5
computed
with
the
model
.
Unlike
the
point
—
by
—
point
comparison
for
SLP
and
Um
,
HS
was
integrated
in
space
and
time
,
which
reduces
the
random
part
of
the
uncertainty
associated
with
wave
height
visual
estimation
(
e.g.
Gulev
et
al.
,
2003
)
.

H5
was
then
integrated
over
a
box
spanning
20
°
W
—
6
°
W
and
44
°
N
—
52
°

This
area
was
selected
because
it
corresponds
to
the
area
where
the
largest
number
of
observation
is
available
in
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
.
Statistical
errors
were
computed
between
model
results
and
observations
(
Fig.

,
Table
1
)
.
Years
with
less
than
one
observation
everyday
were
arbitrarily
removed
from
the
computation
.
Model
results
were
also
compared
against
the

hindcast
of
Dodet
et
al.
(
2010
)
that
uses
NCEP/NCAR

and

The
comparison
between
observed

over

shows
a

.
The

of
Dodet

slightly
better
matches
the
observations
with
an
RMSD
of
0.12
m
(
3.6
%

)
and
a
nil

.
H5
from
ERA40
has
a
much
larger
error
,
mainly
due
to
a
0.5
m
negative
bias
,
which
may
be
related
to
the
2.0
m/s
negative
bias
in
Um
shown
above
.
Since
the
use
of
VOS
data
to
validate
our
wave
hindcast
is
unpublished
to
date
and
could
thus
be
questionable
,
we
also
performed
a
comparison
with

computed
from

and
retrieved
from

This

with
only
a

with

values
over

To
the

,

decreases
progressively
to
about
2.0

Linear

for
H5
were
computed
over
the
period
1900-2008
and
the
results
are
shown
on
Fig.

.
A
clear
global
increase
can
be
seen
all
over
the
North
Atlantic

and
the
trends
are
signiﬁcant
almost
everywhere
at
more

the

In

the

are
larger
at

)
with

.
Such
trends
are
equivalent
to
an
increase
of
more
than
1.0
m
over
the
studied
period
,
which
corresponds
locally
to
a
more
than
40
%
increase
of
the
yearly

mean
value
.
These
upward
trends
decrease
to
the

to
less

but
combined
with
lower
yearly

H5
,
these
trends
still
represent
a
15
%
increase
over
the
period
1900-2008
.
In
order
to
tentatively
explain
these
trends
,
Pearson
correlation
coefﬁcients
were
computed
between
the
yearly
—
mean
station
—
based
NAO
index
(
Hurrell
,
1995
)
and
yearly
—
mean
H5
(
Fig.

)
.
These
correlation
maps
reveal
a
signiﬁcant
(
at
more
than
95
%
)
and
large
positive
correlation
area
to
the
North
—
East
of
the
study
area
,
with
correlation
coefﬁcients
exceeding
0.5

A
signiﬁcant
negative
correlation
area
develops
between
30
°
and
40
°
N
,
with
correlation
coefﬁcients
reaching
-0.5
.
Finally
,
a
last
signiﬁcant
and
weakly
positive
correlation
area
developed
to
the
South
—
East
of
the
study
area
,
with
correlation
coefﬁcients
reaching
0.3
.
To
distinguish
between
linear
trends
and
inter
—
annual
variability
driven
by
the
NAO
,
a
decomposition
in
Empirical
Orthogonal
Functions
(
hereafter
EOFS
;
Preisendorfer
,
1988
)
of
yearly
—
mean
time
series
of
HS
was
performed
(
Fig.
5
)
.
This
analysis
shows
that
the
1st
mode
of
decomposition
explains
74
%
of
the
total
variance
of
yearly
—
mean
H5
.
The
corresponding
spatial
pattern
of
this
mode
(
Fig.
5A
)
matches
closely
that
of
the
linear
trends
of
Fig.
4B
.
The
time
—
series
of
the
ﬁrst
EOF
conﬁrms
that
this
mode
corresponds
to
the
increase
in
H5
over
the
studied
period
.
In
details
,
the
increase
is
strong
during
a
ﬁrst
period
from
1900
to
1960
,
followed
by
a
second
period
from
1960
to
2008
where
the
increase
is
much
weaker
.
The
second
mode
of
decomposition
(
Fig.
5B
)
explains
9
%
of
the
total
variance
of
yearly
—
mean
H5
and
the
associated
spatial
pattern
strongly
matches
that
of
the
correlation
map
between
yearlymean
H5
and
NAO
index
(
Fig.
4C
)
.
This
agreement
is
conﬁrmed
by
the
associated
time
—
series
,
which
is
well
correlated
with
the
yearly
—
mean
NAO
index
(
R2
=
0.73
,
Fig.
5B
)
although
the
correlation
drops
between
1920
and
1930
.
In
order
to
better
quantify
this
behavior
,
Pearson
correlation
coefﬁcients
were
computed
over
a
10
year
sliding
window
,
which
reveals
that
correlation
coefﬁcients
range
from
0.6
to
0.9
over
the
whole
period
and
drop
to
0.45
from
1920
to
1930

Discussion
and
conclusions
4.1
.
Signiﬁcance
of
the
trends
This
study
relies
on
a
new
numerical
wave
hindcast
,
driven
by
wind
ﬁelds
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
starting
in
1900
.
A
validation
of
wave
predictions
after
1955
was
undertaken
based
on
VOS
and
revealed
that
errors
for
yearly
—
mean
H5
were
of
the
order
of
5
%
.
A
similar
direct
validation
prior
to
1950
was
not
possible
since
,
according
to
the
author
's
knowledge
,
wave
measurements
or
consistent
observation
is
insufﬁciently
available
.
This
difﬁculty
questions
the
reliability
of
our
results
for
the
period
1900-1955
,
although
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
shown
to
be
homogeneous
for
the
North
Atlantic
over
the
20th
century
(
Wang
et
al.
,
in
press
)
.
Alternatively
,
U10
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
compared
against
measurements
from
VOS
,
which
revealed
that
errors
on
this
parameter
only
increased
by
10
%
for
the
ﬁrst
half
of
the
20th
century
.
Nevertheless
,
the
values
of
RMSD
for
U10
(
around
3.5
ms
‘
1
)
are
50
%
larger
compared
to
the
values
usually
obtained
when
comparing
atmospheric
reanalysis
with
buoys
(
e.g.
Chawla
et
al.
,
in
press
)
or
satellite
scatterometer
(
e.g.
Dee
et
al.
,
2011
;
Durrant
et
al.
,
in
press
)
.
In
addition
to
the
probably
weaker
quality
of
VOS
data
compared
to
buoy
modern
measurements
or
scaterrometers
,
this
difference
may
originate
from
the
interpolations
in
space
(
the
three
atmospheric
reanalyzes
have
spatial
resolutions
of
the
order
of
2
°
)
and
in
time
(
3
—
to
6
—
hourly
data
)
associated
with
our
RMSD
computation
.
However
,
the
comparison
between
VOS
and
20CR
aimed
at
investigating
how
much
U10
used
to
drive
our
wave
hindcast
deteriorates
over
the
studied
period
time
rather
than
providing
an
absolute
validation
of
the
20CR
reanalysis
.
It
is
accepted
that
the
dependence
of
HS
on
the
wind
speed
U
obeys
a
relationship
of
the
form
H5
:
U
”
,
where
[
5
is
a
coefﬁcient
varying
between
1
for
short
—
fetch
limited
conditions
and
2
for
fully
developed
seas
(
Ardhuin
et
al.
,
2007
;
janssen
,
2008
)
.
In
this
study
,
the
~
10
%
larger
errors
in
wind
speed
for
the
ﬁrst
half
of
the
20th
century
would
increase
the
NRMSE
in
H5
from
5
%
for
the
period
1950-2008
to
6
%
for
the
period
1900-1950
.
Consequently
,
the
20
to
40
%
increases
in
H5
that
we
demonstrated
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
still
hold
robustly
.

Comparison
with
previous
studies
Several
studies
have
already
reported
increases
in

in
the
North

least
at
a
95
%
conﬁdence
level
.
the
inter
—
annual
variability
of
H5
at
northern
latitudes
was
shown
to
be
partly
controlled
by
the
NAO
and
the
reported
upward
trends
in
H5
were
to
some
extend
explained
by
a
strong
increase
in
the
NAO
index
over
the
last
6
decades
(
Woolf
et
al.
,
2002
;
Dodet
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
this
study
,
a
signiﬁcant
and
positive
correlation
between
H5
and
the
NAO
index
was
also
identiﬁed
in
the
North
—
East
Atlantic
Ocean
,
although
weaker
than
in
Dodet
et
al.
(
2010
)
who
used
winter
—
mean
parameters
.
Unlike
previous
studies
focused
on
the
last
5
to
6
decades
,
the
NAO
index
does
not
experience
any
signiﬁcant
trend
over
the
period
1900-2008
.
This
implies
that
the
large
increase
in
H5
(
up
to
more
than
40
%
)
demonstrated
over
the
whole
North
Atlantic
Ocean
can
not
be
explained
by
the
NAO
.
Our
interpretation
is
that
a
long
—
term
upward
trend
is
superimposed
on
the
partly
NAO
—
controlled
inter
—
annual
variability
of
HS
.
This
hypothesis
is
corroborated
by
the
EOF
analysis
,
which
shows
that
the
dominant
mode
is
clearly
correlated
with
the
spatial
and
temporal
variations
of
the
upward
trend
(
Fig.
5A
)
.
The
spatial
patterns
and
the
magnitude
of
our
trends
differ
from
those
of
Wang
et
al.
(
2012
)
,
who
statistically
reconsuucted
HS
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
for
the
period
1871-2010
based
on
SLP
originating
from
20CR
.
Nevertheless
,
their
study
investigates
a
different
period
of
time
and
different
wave
parameters
(
seasonal
means
and
maximum
)
,
which
turns
delicate
the
comparison
with
our
study
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
order
of
magnitude
of
the
upward
trends
we
found
in
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
matches
the
ﬁndings
of
other
studies
in
other
region
of
the
world
's
ocean
.
Thus
,
Reguero
et
al.
(
2013
)
performed
a
wave
numerical
hindcast
around
Latin
America
based
on
NCEP/NCAR
U10
and
found
trends
reaching
locally
0.01

for
the
period
1948-2012
.
In
the
North

,
Ruggiero
et
al.
(

)
used
wave
buoy
measurements
and
found
a
0.015
m.
yr
‘
]
increase
for
the
yearly

HS
over
the
last
35
years
.
This
value
is
corroborated
by
the
ﬁndings
of
Gulev
and
Grigorieva
(
2004
)
who
found
a

and
depicted
an
upward

in

for
northern

western

over

.
Trends
in
wind

were
also
computed
over
the
whole
North
Atlantic

and
this
analysis
revealed
a
generalized
increase
in
Um

ranging
from

over
a

spanning

These
upward
trends
in
wind
speed
directly
explain
the
upward
trends
in

described
in
the
previous
section
.
Unfortunately
,
based
on

,
it
was
not
possible
to
determine
the
causes
for
the
upward

in

identiﬁed
over

On

found
that

would
only
induce

in

al.
,

)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
other
studies
relying
on
climate
model
experiments
(
e.g.
Donat
et
al.
,
2010
)
have
suggested
that
enhanced
greenhouse
gas
forcing
would
yield
more
frequent
and
stronger
wind
storms
.
Under
this
absence
of
consensus
,
we
can
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
the
increase
in
wind
speed
and
wave
height
identiﬁed
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
could
result
,
at
least
partly
,
from
the
increase
in
greenhouse
gas
concentrations
over
the
last
centuries
.
4.4
.
Consequences
of
these
results
In
addition
to
direct
consequences
on
navigation
,
offshore
engineering
and
even
climate
dynamics
due
to
wave
—
induced
heat
and
mass
ﬂuxes
(
e.g.
,
through
wave
—
induced
turbulence
,
drag
modiﬁcation
and
aerosols
)
,
the
increase
in
H5
in
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
that
we
demonstrated
in
this
study
has
strong
implications
on
coastal
zone
dynamics
.
Thus
,
the
increase
in
coastal
erosion
observed
in
westem
Europe
over
the
last
century
(
e.g.
Eurosion
,
2003
)
could
be
related
to
the
roughening
of
the
wave
climate
at
northern
latitudes
and
not
only
to
long
—
terrn
sea
—
level
rise
(
Bruun
,
1962
)
and
decrease
in
sediment
supply
from
rivers
due
to
dams
.
This
hypothesis
matches
the
recent
conclusions
of
Ruggiero
(
2013
)
,
who
proposed
that
the
wave
height
increases
in
the
NE
Paciﬁc
have
had
a
more
signiﬁcant
role
in
the
increased
coastal
erosion
than
sea
level
rise
.
To
investigate
this
hypothesis
further
,
one
promising
perspective
would
be
to
force
coastal
area
morphodynamic
models
(
e.g.
besser
et
al.
,
2004
;
Bertin
et
al.
,
2009
)
with
time
series
of
wave
spectra
originating
from
the
hindcast
presented
in
this
study
.
