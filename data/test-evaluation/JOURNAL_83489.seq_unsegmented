Antarctic ice and sediment flux in the Oligocene simulated by a climate–ice sheet–sediment model Abstract A model of deforming sediment is added to a climate–ice sheet model, and applied to the Eocene–Oligocene transition in Antarctic ice volume around 34 Ma. The coupling between the global climate and ice sheet models is asynchronous, with a climate simulation performed once every 10 000 years, and only for the first 40 000 years. These global climate model solutions are re-used to perform runs of 400 000 years in length, with orbital forcing and different levels of CO 2 . The sediment model includes bulk transport under ice, generation of sub-ice till, and river transport, and predicts the continental-scale evolution of sediment thickness and coastal discharge. For the first few 10 000’s of years after the onset of substantial ice (triggered by CO 2 falling below ∼3× pre-industrial level), sediment discharge to the ocean is relatively uniform around the coast, derived from nearby pre-existing regolith. After that, most discharge is concentrated into ∼4 sites at the mouths of major trough systems, with orbitally paced pulses on 10 4 -yr scales. These sites and the average magnitudes of the fluxes agree generally with those deduced from offshore seismic and core data, although longer (10 my) integrations are needed to model the real sediment evolution.

Introduction This paper describes further results of a global climate model (GCM) coupled to a 3-D dynamic ice sheet model of Antarctica ( DeConto and Pollard, 2003a and DeConto and Pollard, 2003b ). In those papers the model is applied to the Eocene–Oligocene transition around 34 Ma when Antarctic ice expanded suddenly to volumes comparable to today, and the relative roles of atmospheric CO 2 , oceanic heat transport, and Milankovitch orbital variations in the early ice sheet sequences are examined. The main results that are important here are: (1) the critical atmospheric CO 2 concentration for the onset of major Cenozoic Antarctic glaciation is ∼2–3× pre-industrial level (PAL, 280 ppmv), and (2) for some CO 2 levels within this range, distinct land-based ice sheets nucleate on regions of high topography, expanding and contracting strongly with Milankovitch orbital forcing. In this paper a model of deforming sediment is described and added to the ice-climate model, in order: (1) to explore the possible role of sediment in ice sheet evolution, and (2) to predict coastal sediment fluxes and begin comparing with data from offshore drilling. Very rich data-model comparisons may be possible for Mid-Cenozoic sediment on continental shelves and slopes around Antarctica, involving the timing of first till-derived deposits at specific sites, and subsequent orbital and longer term variations in sedimentation. A number of such cores have been obtained and more are planned by initiatives such as ANTOSTRAT ( Cooper et al., 1995 and Barker et al., 1998 ) and the Cape Roberts Project ( Davey et al., 2001 and Naish et al., 2001 ). Widely distributed deforming sediment may play significant roles in the large-scale morphology and long-term evolution of ice sheets ( Alley et al., 1987a and Alley et al., 1987b ). The reduced basal shear stresses over deforming till around the outer southern margins of the Laurentide may have been responsible for its thin profile there ( Clark et al., 1996 ), and may have enabled surging lobes around the Last Glacial Maximum ( Clark, 1994 , Jenson et al., 1995 and Jenson et al., 1996 ); similar oscillations of West Antarctica have been suggested by MacAyeal (1992) . The long-term evolution of Laurentide ice-volume variations through the Quaternary may have been influenced initially by a ubiquitous layer of regolith over Canada, produced by ice-free weathering through the Cenozoic. It may have been gradually eroded and transported to the southern margins, exposing Canadian Shield bedrock to the north ( Alley, 1991 ); this could explain the change in character of the orbital response at the Mid-Pleistocene Transition ( Clark and Pollard, 1998 ). Deforming sediment is observed today below fast-moving West Antarctic ice streams, but whether its rheology is slightly or highly non-linear is controversial ( Alley, 2000 and Kamb, 2001 ). Our model of sub-ice sediment transport, following Jenson et al. (1996) and Clark and Pollard (1998) , uses slightly non-linear rheology which allows significant sediment shear in the upper tens of centimeters to ∼meter of the layer. However, significant bulk till transport may still occur even with highly non-linear rheology ( Tulaczyk, 1999 and Alley, 2000 ). Dowdeswell and Siegert (1999) have applied a similar ice sheet–sediment model to the Late Pleistocene Eurasian ice sheet and compared with observed offshore sediments, while MacAyeal (1992) included deforming sediment in a finite-element model of the West Antarctic ice sheet over the last one million years, and Hildes (2001) included sediment processes in long-term runs beneath the Quaternary North American ice sheets. Boulton (1996) and Hindmarsh (1996) have used this type of sediment model in more general flowline studies. In these models bulk sediment is transported by induced horizontal velocities within the sediment layer. It can also be transported by entrainment or freeze-on into the basal ice ( Alley and MacAyeal, 1994 and Hildes, 2001 ), which is neglected here. Two other model components are needed for a basic representation of long-term sediment budgets and coastal sediment fluxes: (1) ice-free transport of till (moraines) to the coast by rivers, and (2) generation of new till by the abrading/plucking action of basal ice and clasts on exposed bedrock. River transport is not significant for modern Antarctica, but was presumably important in the Early Oligocene when the ice sheets were smaller and significant parts of the continent were ice-free. The generation of new deformable till by the action of ice/deforming till on the original bedrock/compacted till has been modeled among others by Alley (1990) , Iverson (1991) , Hallet (1996) , Cuffey and Alley (1996) , and used in long-term simulations by MacAyeal (1992) , Dowdeswell and Siegert (1999) and Hildes (2001) . We include simple parameterizations of both these processes as described below. 2. Models 2.1. Climate, ice sheet, and coupling The climate and ice sheet components and coupling methods are described in DeConto and Pollard, 2003a and DeConto and Pollard, 2003b and earlier papers. Briefly, the GENESIS v2 GCM is used with ∼3.75° atmospheric resolution and a 50-m slab ocean ( Thompson and Pollard, 1997 ). The stored monthly mean climate fields are interpolated to the fine-grid topography of the ice sheet model using constant lapse-rate corrections. A positive-degree day parameterization is used to calculate the net annual surface mass balance (e.g. Ritz et al., 1997 ), with allowance for diurnal cycles, superimposed ice and refreezing of meltwater (using early springtime melt to saturate the winter snowpack before it becomes mobile). A standard 3-D dynamic ice sheet model is used, following the established lineage of Huybrechts (1990) , Ritz et al. (1997) and others. The ice grid is either 1°×1° for some earlier runs, or polar stereographic with a 40-km grid size for all runs described below. Ice temperatures are predicted mainly for their important effect on ice rheology and basal conditions. Vertical diffusive temperature profiles are also predicted through the upper ∼2 km of bedrock, using 6 unequal levels, and a uniform geothermal heat flux of 0.9 μcal cm −2 s −1 . There are no ice shelves; ice is removed seaward of the continental shoreline (thus the initiation of West Antarctica, which requires a phase of ice shelves/calving fronts joining the Oligocene western islands to the mainland, is postponed to future work). Both the GCM and ice sheet models use a reconstruction of Early Oligocene geography, topography and sea level by Hay et al. (1999) . The higher resolution ice sheet model uses superimposed present-day Antarctic bedrock elevations ( Bamber and Bindschadler, 1997 ), isostatically rebounded with present ice removed. Since it is computationally infeasible to run the GCM continuously for tens of thousands of years, the coupling between the climate and ice sheet models is necessarily asynchronous. As described in DeConto and Pollard, 2003a and DeConto and Pollard, 2003b , we have performed asynchronous integrations of 40 000-year duration by running the GCM to seasonal equilibrium (25 years) once every 10 000 years, updating the boundary conditions for the current ice sheet and orbit each time. The stored GCM climate fields of monthly temperature and precipitation are used to run the ice sheet model through the next 10 000 years (recalculating surface mass balance every 200 years as the ice elevations change). Idealized orbital variations are assumed, so that the 40 000 years exactly span 2 precessional cycles, 1 obliquity cycle, and 1/2 of an eccentricity cycle. For longer durations such as the 400 000-year runs described below, the set of 5 GCM solutions from the initial 40 000 years are used repeatedly, interpolating in time between the 2 surrounding GCM solutions. The sequence of 5 GCM solutions is used in alternating directions (1 to 5, then back from 5 to 1, etc.), yielding smoothly varying eccentricity cycles with 80 000-year periodicity. After the first 40 000 years, the prescribed ice sheet extents in the GCM solutions no longer match those in the ice-model integration; i.e. we are ignoring the feedback of the ice on the large-scale climate (although the simple lapse rate corrections still capture much of the important interaction). We doubt that this seriously affects the results, since the ice sheet cycles do not depart radically from those in the first 40 000 years; however, this should be kept in mind in detailed assessment of the results. 2.2. Sediment model 2.2.1. Sub-ice transport The model of deforming sediment under ice closely follows Clark and Pollard (1998) , with extensions to 2-D and predicted temperatures. It is quite similar in concept and behavior to the flowline model of Boulton (1996) . Bulk transport of sediment thickness occurs due to horizontal shear velocities in the upper tens of centimeters to meters of sediment, induced by the basal shear stress of the ice assuming a weakly non-linear sediment rheology ( Jenson et al., 1995 and Jenson et al., 1996 ). When the sediment is thin and the shear zone extends to bedrock, the sediment velocity at the bedrock interface is assumed to be zero; in future work this may be replaced by a sediment–bedrock sliding law ( Cuffey and Alley, 1996 and Hindmarsh, 1996 ). Sediment deformation can only occur where the basal temperature is at the pressure melting point, and there is presumably enough liquid water to lubricate and mobilize the sediment. The effective pressure is then assumed to be nearly zero at the ice–sediment interface, increasing downwards due to the buoyant weight of the sediment ( Jenson et al., 1995 and Jenson et al., 1996 ); we plan to add more explicit basal hydrology in future work. The temperature profile through the sediment is predicted at 6 equi-spaced levels, along with those in the ice above and 2 km of bedrock below, determined by vertical heat diffusion and local friction with heat advection by sediment ignored. If the upper portion of sediment in contact with the ice is frozen and overlays an unfrozen portion, then the lower portion still deforms and the upper portion is advected along with the basal ice ( Alley et al., 1997 ). There can be basal sliding of the ice at the ice–sediment interface (or ice–bedrock interface if no sediment), when the basal temperature is at the melt point. As in Clark and Pollard (1998) , all simulations with sediment are initialized with a uniform 50-m layer everywhere, representing the surface regolith weathered over the previous tens of millions of years with no major ice sheets. The parameterization described below represents perturbations due to ice sheets on the earlier long-term landscape equilibrium, omitting slower processes responsible for the maintenance of the ice-free equilibrium. This concept is consistent with much of the discussion in Bell and Laine (1985) . In lieu of a detailed basin/landscape model of erosion/deposition/hydrologic transport ( Syvitski et al., 1998 ), we parameterize non-ice transport and generation of new till very simply, as discussed below. 2.2.2. River transport Previously disturbed sediment at any ice-free point is transported downhill, following the steepest non-ice-path descent, to either the ocean, the shore of an inland lake, or an ice dam, where it is deposited. The transport itself is instantaneous, but the capture of the sediment source occurs at a rate of 0.01 m/yr. Inland lakes are closed basins in the current topography, assumed to be filled to their overflow point, located by running a basin-finding algorithm every 100 years. River transport can only act on sediment to depths that have been ‘disturbed’ by ice-induced motion when previously under the ice sheet. This is implemented easily by saving the thickness of (immobile) undisturbed sediment at each point, which is reduced only if ice-induced shear penetrates below the current undisturbed horizon at each time step. Since this is a ‘perturbation’ model as defined above, any undisturbed sediment is assumed to be in long-term landscape equilibrium and is left alone; in any case, its landscape evolution probably occurs on much longer time scales since it is more consolidated and less susceptible to erosion by flowing water ( Bell and Laine, 1985 ). This simple parameterization, and the 0.01-m/yr rate constant, are consistent with the following observations on North American Quaternary glaciation: (1) most (∼90%) of the Canadian sediment moved by the Laurentide to its southern periphery in the last ∼3 million years, with original average depth of ∼100–200 m, has been transported by rivers to Atlantic marine sediments; (2) the time scale of this transport is fast compared to orbital time scales and major ice sheet advances and retreats ( Laine, 1980 , Bell and Laine, 1985 and Alley, 1991 ). 2.2.3. Till generation If the sediment thickness is less than 0.5 m, new sediment is generated by the action of basal ice on exposed bedrock, at a rate proportional to the work done by basal sliding (i.e. basal shear stress × basal sliding velocity), with the constant of proportionality increasing as the sediment thins: where E is the generation rate (m/s), S is sediment thickness (m) if less than 0.5 m, τ is basal shear stress (Pa) and v is basal ice sliding velocity (m/s). This represents erosion of bedrock by the ice, exposed between presumed discontinuous patches of sediment. It captures the slowing effect of existing till on its own replacement ( Alley, 2000 ); the value of 0.5 m is uncertain, and smaller than the e-folding values of 2.0–6.5 m used by Hildes (2001) . In early tests we also limited E by the rate of supply of liquid water from basal melting, needed to fill the pores of the new till ( MacAyeal, 1992 ); however, this was very rarely rate-limiting and scarcely affected the results. Note that the parameterization does not represent generation by the action of deforming till at the till–bedrock interface; Cuffey and Alley (1996) argue that this is usually much slower than other processes. 2.2.4. Coastal sediment flux Coastal ocean grid squares (sharing an edge with a land grid square) can receive sediment either by ice-induced bulk advection across that edge when the ice sheet reaches the coast (some as iceberg/shelf freeze-on; Alley et al., 1997 ), or by river transport at the final oceanic points of downhill paths from ice-free inland areas containing previously disturbed sediment. The amount of sediment received by each coastal ocean point is kept track of as the model runs, and is used to report coastal sediment fluxes; there is no further physical modeling of oceanic transport on the continental shelf or slope. 3. Results 3.1. No sediment The time series of ice volume with no sediment ( Fig. 1 ) illustrates the main results from DeConto and Pollard, 2003a and DeConto and Pollard, 2003b . At 3×CO 2 , the ice volume remains small and confined as separate ice caps on areas of high topography. At 2×CO 2 , a large single ice sheet is maintained spanning most of East Antarctica. In the latter case, the orbital variations are small since the ice extent is confined mostly by the continental shoreline and not by land-based ablation zones, as for present Antarctica. To investigate behavior at intermediate CO 2 values, corresponding to conditions in the few million years following the onset of significant ice at ∼34 Ma, we performed another 400-ka ice sheet run using the set of 2×CO 2 GCM climates with an arbitrary 2°C increase applied to all GCM air temperatures. This produces much larger variations in ice volume on orbital time scales ( Fig. 1b ), corresponding to sea-level amplitudes (∼40 m) and ocean-water δ W amplitudes (∼0.3 permil) deduced from high-resolution cores during 34–30 Ma ( Zachos et al., 1996 and Zachos et al., 2001 ). They are reminiscent of Quaternary Laurentide and Eurasian ice sheet variations in the last two million years, but without complete deglaciations on ∼100 000 year time scales, possibly due to the absence of deglacial mechanisms for East Antarctica such as marine collapse or ocean/CO 2 feedbacks ( Pollard, 1983 , Hughes, 1987 and DeBlonde and Peltier, 1993 ). There is a pronounced periodicity of 80 ka in the response, due to the idealized periods in our orbital forcing and the large sustained amplitude of eccentricity variations. Every 80 ka, eccentricity, obliquity and precession align to yield coldest possible austral summer temperatures. Although real orbital sequences do occasionally align in this way, their phase relationships are generally more irregular ( Berger and Loutre, 1991 ). 3.2. With sediment The simulations in this section are all initiated with a uniform 50-m layer of undisturbed sediment over all Antarctica, representing pre-existing weathered regolith prior to major ice onset at ∼34 Ma. The effect of sediment on the time series of ice volume is shown in Fig. 2 . For the 2×CO 2 and 2×CO 2 +2°C runs, the amplitude of the orbital cycles is considerably larger than without sediment, as expected from the generally thinner profiles (∼10% overall) and wider ablation zones caused by the reduced basal shear stress. The same effect is found for the Laurentide before and after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition ( Clark and Pollard, 1998 ), and also in 10-Ma runs with this model ( DeConto and Pollard, 2003a ). During the first several 10 000’s of years (first orbital pulse), the continental average sediment cover shown by dashed curves decreases quite rapidly, as original regolith near the coast is pushed to the ocean (see below). After this, a new long-term equilibrium is approached with a smaller mean thickness, and with coastal flux nearly balanced by sub-ice generation of new till. In the rest of the paper, we concentrate on the 2×CO 2 +2°C run shown in Fig. 2b , which has the largest ice volume variations and is probably most representative of conditions shortly after 34 Ma ( DeConto and Pollard, 2003a and DeConto and Pollard, 2003b ). Fig. 3 shows ice thicknesses and extents at particular times in that run, including more or less maximum and minimum extents of ice. Under hostile orbital periods corresponding to hot summers, the ice retreats to separate ice caps on high topography in coastal Queen Maud Land, Gamburtsev Mountains, and Transantarctic Mountains; these later re-advance to merge into a single large ice sheet. The distribution of sediment at particular times is shown in Fig. 4 , and the final distribution is shown in Fig. 5 . Between ∼20 and 60 ka, large moraines form in the vicinity of ∼80S, 0E, by poleward ice motion from inland flanks of the coastal mountains in Queen Maud Land (see Boulton, 1996 ). Some other local concentrations of sediment are due to river transport into closed depressions of the original bedrock topography, subsequently deepened by isostatic depression of the bedrock (e.g. ∼84S, 5E, and ∼80S, 110E); in reality, some of these probably become basal lakes like Lake Vostok. Transport of sediment by ice is not ubiquitous, since it requires flowing ice cover and basal temperatures at the melt point. At some locations, mostly on high topography within a few hundred km off the coast, these conditions are realized often, and all initial sediment is quickly cleared away. The areas of basal melting shown in Fig. 6 (for the same times as in Fig. 3 ) are generally limited to fast flowing ice near the ice sheet margins. In other areas with thicker (higher) ice, basal temperatures are most often below freezing, so little long-term sediment transport occurs; the same is true in regions never reached by ice, and also on spreading centers (mountain plateaus) where basal shear stress and velocities are small. The blank areas in Fig. 7 show regions which remain ice free for the entire run ( Fig. 7a ), or where basal ice temperatures never reach the melt point ( Fig. 7b ). There is a close correspondence between the latter and the areas where the sediment is never disturbed ( Fig. 5 ). The regions of basal melting when the ice is large ( Fig. 6a ) agree basically with modern estimates near the coast ( Wilch and Hughes, 2000 ), but lack some of the inland regions under thicker ice predicted to be at the melt point today by 3-D models ( Huybrechts, 1990 and Verbitsky and Saltzman, 1997 ). This could well be due to our central ice being considerably thinner than today ( Fig. 3 ), requiring less contrast between surface and basal temperatures to conduct the geothermal heat flux. The main reason for this thinness is probably the model’s inability to form a buttressing West Antarctic Ice Sheet, as noted above and in Section 4 . 3.3. Coastal sediment flux Fig. 8 shows the temporal and spatial variations of coastal sediment fluxes in the 2×CO 2 +2°C run, and Fig. 9 shows the average fluxes over the entire run. The timing of coastal sediment discharge is not uniform, with pulses on O(10 4 )-yr time scales due to orbitally paced ice advances and retreats. In the first few 10 000’s of years, there are small fluxes more or less uniformly around the entire perimeter of East Antarctica, pushed locally to the sea whenever the ice margin reaches the ocean at maximum ice orbital extents. These near-coastal regions are soon exhausted of sediment ( Fig. 4b ), and the fluxes mostly diminish, except in a few major valley outlets down which most of the continental interior sediment is moved, either by river or sub-ice transport. For example, the large moraines inland from the coastal mountains in Queen Maud Land are transported downslope to the west, alternately by rivers or by ice advances down the same topographic trough, to discharge at two locations on the eastern edge of the Weddell Sea near the present-day grounding line of the Filchner Ice Shelf (∼30W, 80S). Similar concentrations of moraines and coastal discharge occur as ice is funneled down other major topographic bedrock valleys: down the Lambert Graben discharging at the Amery Ice Shelf into Prdyz Bay (∼59E), east of the Shackleton Ice Shelf at (∼104 E), and down Wilkes Basin discharging near the present Adelie Coast (∼138 E). Time series of instantaneous (2-ka mean) flux at each of the major discharge sites are shown in Fig. 10 . The orbital pulses are clearly seen, although they are not all in phase with ice volume ( Fig. 2b ); the large pulses around 60–80 ka are lagged relative to the peak in ice volume, due to the finite rate of sediment transport. The first pulses are very large (except at the Weddell site), due to the plentiful availability of original regolith. Discharge occurs first at the Weddell site, followed ∼20 ka later at the other sites. These timings are not expected to correspond to actual events, since they depend arbitrarily on the orbital sequence and the initial conditions of the run (relatively low CO 2 and no ice); in the real world, a long-term decline of CO 2 probably caused more gradual ice expansion and longer intervals between first discharges around the coast. For the same reasons, only order-of-magnitude comparisons with observed sediment data are appropriate at this stage. It is encouraging that three of the major sites of sediment discharge noted above correspond with major offshore Cenozoic sediment deposits where near-shore drilling efforts have been concentrated ( Barker et al., 1998 ). One exception is the Cape Roberts site, which in our model receives only small locally derived discharge as does most of the Ross Sea coastline ( Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 ). At no time during our runs does large sediment transport occur over the Transantarctic Mountains into the western Ross Sea, suggesting: (1) this occurred later in the Oligocene or Miocene when CO 2 was somewhat lower (than our equivalent 2×CO 2 +2°C) with more ice transport through the Transantarctics ( Davey et al., 2001 ); (2) sediment fluxes there were always small, derived from nearby sources with no concentrated outlets, or most likely; and (3) our 40-km grid does not sufficiently resolve valleys to allow eastward flux through the Transantarctics. The magnitude of the long-term average fluxes in Fig. 9 at the major discharge sites is ∼20 m/ka, spread over one oceanic grid box (40×40 km), i.e. 32 km 3 /ka. Around the bays of each site, the minor contributions from other coastal points combine to yield a similar magnitude. Spreading these over a typical area of a major offshore sediment fan, ∼50 000 km 2 say, yields a sedimentation rate over a fan of 1.3 m/ka. This value is an order of magnitude larger than long-term thickness-age relationships in Oligocene and Miocene Antarctic offshore deposits deduced from seismic and core data ( Barker et al., 1998 , Naish et al., 2001 and Davey et al., 2001 ; papers in Florindo and Cooper, 2001 ), which generally show hundreds of meters of sediment per ∼10 Ma, i.e. 0.05 m/ka. However, this discrepancy could well be due to intervals of offshore erosion at particular sites ( Naish et al., 2001 ) that are beyond the scope of the model. Note also that our simulations to date are relatively short with arbitrary combinations of initial sediment and CO 2 values, and do not purport to model the real long-term evolution over tens of millions of years. Faster sedimentation rates more in accord with the model values are observed for short intervals on orbital time scales, in the Ross Sea around the Oligocene–Miocene boundary ( Naish et al., 2001 ) and in the Barents Sea from the Pleistocene Eurasian ice sheet ( Dowdeswell and Siegert, 1999 ). Using a similar ice sheet/sediment model, the latter study found maximum sedimentation rates at 15 ka BP of 0.13 and 0.6 cm/yr (1.3–6 m/ka) and longer-term averages several times smaller, i.e. the same general magnitude but slightly smaller than ours. Over the entire 400 ka of our 2×CO 2 +2°C run reported above, a total of 317 727 km 3 of sediment was delivered to the oceans. This is not exactly the average reduction of sediment on land, which is offset partially by sub-ice generation of new till (89 721 km 3 over the run). However, the flux to the oceans corresponds to the work of Bell and Laine (1985) , who estimated volumes of Atlantic marine sediments derived from Laurentide erosion. Our oceanic sediment flux above is equivalent to a land-average loss of 0.070 m/ka. This magnitude agrees well with Bell and Laine’s (1985) estimate of at least ∼120 m for the average ice-induced erosion from the Laurentide region of North America during the last 3 Ma, i.e. 0.040 m/ka. (Note that all of our flux volumes have the model’s land-sediment density of 2390 kg/m 3 , and have not been converted to marine volumes which have lower densities; Bell and Laine, 1985 , table 1). 4. Concluding remarks The new results in this paper concern sediment: its effect on the ice sheets, and the predicted fluxes of sediment delivered to the coast. • Deforming sediment under the ice amplifies the orbital variations by its reduction of basal shear stress and thinning of the ice profiles, as found previously for Northern Hemispheric Quaternary ice sheets. However, no analog of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition or 100-ka cycles occur in this East Antarctic model, due to the absence of deglacial mechanisms such as marine collapse or CO 2 feedbacks. • A crude model of sediment evolution including instantaneous downhill river transport shows that some areas are cleared quickly of sediment down to bedrock, corresponding to regions often covered by ice with basal temperatures at the melt point. In other regions the pre-existing sediment survives, at least for the first few million years after ice onset. These are regions where either the early ice sheets rarely or never reach (for instance, a large area from 80 to 90S, just inland from the modern Filchner ice shelf), or where basal temperatures are usually below freezing and/or basal velocities are usually low (such as spreading centers on high topography). • The predicted coastal sediment flux for the first several 10 000’s of years (first orbital pulse) after ice onset is distributed quite uniformly around East Antarctica, as local sediment is transported downslope to the coast. After that, most of the flux occurs at a few coastal sites at the mouths of major topographic troughs, down which the majority of inland continental sediment is transported (E. Weddell Sea, Lambert/Amery/Prydz Bay, ∼104 E, and Wilkes Land/Adelie Coast). In future work, we plan to investigate sediment behavior in longer runs over millions of years during the Oligocene, as in DeConto and Pollard (2002) . This will enable more direct comparisons between sediment fluxes and offshore core data at major discharge sites, including timing of initial onset, orbital variability, and provenance. One important simplification in the model is the omission of ice shelves and/or calving fronts, so that the ice can never advance beyond the coastline as required to form a marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet. As noted above, this probably explains why the central regions of our East Antarctic ice sheet remain relatively thin and frozen to the bed, never disturbing the pre-existing regolith ( Fig. 5 ). The addition of ice shelves to the model ( Huybrechts, 1990 ) will allow predictions of first Cenozoic buildup and subsequent fluctuations of a West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( Harwood et al., 1989 ). Also, finer horizontal resolution will be required to capture West Antarctic ice streams and eastward flow through the Transantarctics. Within the confines of the model structure, there are two main unconstrained parameters that affect long-term sediment budgets: (1) the degree of non-linearity in sub-ice sediment rheology, which affects bulk sediment flux rates, and (2) the production rate of new till at the ice-bedrock interface. We hope to constrain each of these by performing O(10 7 )-yr runs and comparing: (1) average coastal sediment fluxes, and (2) early-to-late variations, with those deduced from offshore core data. Other possible model-data comparisons involve temporal variations in clay mineral lithology found in sediment cores ( Robert and Kennett, 1997 , Robert and Maillot, 1990 and Zachos et al., 1999 ), whose model counterpart is the fraction of original (pre-34-Ma) sediment vs. newly generated till in the coastal sediment fluxes. The model can also predict the provenance of coastal sediment, and the relative amounts delivered by sub-ice transport vs. rivers.
