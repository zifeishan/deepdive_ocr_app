in
the
Neoproterozoic

Bossoroca
Volcanic

:
isotopic
constraints
on
timing
and
sources
Abstract
The
Neoproterozoic
Bossoroca
juvenile
Volcanic
Arc
of
southernmost
Brazil
contains
arc-related
gold
deposits
.
The
Bossoroca
gold
deposit
consists
of
veins
and
stockworks
of
quartz-gold
ores
with
minor
pyrite
,
chalcopyrite
,
galena
and
tellurides
.
Carbonate
,
chlorite
,
sericite
and
tourmaline
are
the
main
gangue
minerals
.
The
ore
shoots
are
contained
in
calc-alkaline
pyroclastic
andesites
and
dacites
with
minor
basalts
and
epiclastic
rocks
of
the
Campestre
Formation
.
SHRIMP
U/Pb
investigations
of
zircon
show
that
the
island-arc
volcanogenic
sequence
was
formed
ca
757
m.y.
ago
in
the
early
Brasiliano
Cycle
and
metamorphosed
into
transitional
greenschist/amphibolite
facies
of
low-pressure
regional
metamorphism
at
ca
700
Ma
.
Nearby
,
the
post-tectonic
São
Sepé
Granite
was
intruded
into
the
volcanic
arc
at
ca
550
Ma
.
The
mineralising
fluids
have
been
related
either
to
metamorphism
or
to
solutions
derived
from
post-tectonic
intrusive
granites
.
Lead
isotopic
analyses
,
carried
out
on
galena
from
the
gold
ore
,
on
feldspar
and
total
rock
from
the
associated
volcanic
pile
,
and
also
on
feldspar
and
total
rock
from
the
São
Sepé
Granite
,
indicate
that
gold
mineralisation
is
related
to
the
volcanogenic
rocks
,
and
that
the
deposit
should
be
considered
to
be
of
an
epizonal
orogenic
type
.

Introduction
Several
small
,
epigenetic
,
quartz
lode-gold
deposits
occur
in
the
Neoproterozoic
juvenile
volcanic
arc
in
the
Precambrian
shield
of
Rio
Grande
do
Sul
State
in
southernmost
Brazil
(
Koppe
,
1990
and
Babinski
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
The
majority
are
enclosed
in
Precambrian
metavolcanosedimentary
sequences
of
low
-
to
medium-metamorphic
grade
of
the
Vacacaı́
Group
.
Others
are
associated
with
granites
and
volcanic
rocks
formed
at
the
end
of
the
Precambrian
to
Early
Paleozoic
.
The
main
deposit
in
the
region
is
the
Bossoroca
lode-gold
deposit
,
which
has
been
mined
for
nearly
seventy
years
.
The
ore
occurs
within
quartz
veins
hosted
by
volcanic
rocks
of
transitional
low
-
to
medium-metamorphic
grade
of
the
juvenile
volcanic
arc
.
This
is
a
small
deposit
which
contains
a
total
of
one
ton
of
gold
with
average
contents
of
about
15
g/ton
(
Koppe
,
1990
)
.
The
mineralisation
could
either
be
related
to
the
regional
metamorphism
or
to
the
intrusion
of
the
nearby
post-tectonic
São
Sepé
Granite
,
or
to
a
related
intrusion
at
depth
.
The
deposit
and
associated
rocks
were
investigated
in
order
to
establish
some
constraints
on
timing
and
metal
sources
of
the
ore-forming
event
,
using
techniques
such
as
sensitive
high-resolution
ion
microprobe
(
SHRIMP
)
U/Pb
isotopic
determinations
on
zircon
(
129
zircon
grains
)
,
Pb
isotope
analyses
on
sulfides
,
feldspars
and
whole
rocks
(
13
samples
)
.
O
and
C
stable
isotope
analyses
of
gangue
carbonates
(
8
samples
)
were
essential
for
constraining
the
source
of
ore
fluids
.

Geological
setting
The
Precambrian
shield
of
Rio
Grande
do
Sul
State
is
part
of
the
southernmost
extension
of
the
Mantiqueira
Province
(
Hasui
et
al.
,
1975
)
and
has
four
major
segments
(
Jost
and
Hartmann
,
1984
,
Soliani
,
1986
,
Fragoso
César
et
al.
,
1986
and
Babinski
et
al.
,
1996
)
as
shown
in
Fig.
1
.
To
the
east
,
the
600
Ma-old
Pelotas
Batholith
,
derived
from
crustal
reworking
of
ca
2.0
Ga-old
tonalite-granodiorite
and
metasedimentary
gneisses
,
is
juxtaposed
against
the
780
Ma-old
Porongos
schist
belt
to
the
west
.
The
schist
belt
is
composed
of
supracrustal
sequences
interleaved
with
ca
2.0
Ga-old
basement
gneisses
.
The
western
part
of
the
shield
contains
the
Taquarembó
Block
in
the
south
and
the
São
Gabriel
Block
in
the
north
.
The
Bossoroca
lode-gold
deposit
occurs
in
the
São
Gabriel
Block
,
near
30
°
S
,
54
°
W
.
This
block
contains
two
major
units
(
Fig.
2
)
.
One
is
the
juvenile
Neoproterozoic
(
Babinski
et
al.
,
1996
)
calc-alkaline
volcano-plutonic
island-arc
association
,
named
the
Cambaı́
Complex
for
the
plutonic
rocks
and
the
Vacacaı́
Group
for
the
volcanic/sedimentary
sequence
.
The
other
unit
in
this
block
is
a
late
to
post-tectonic
volcano-plutono-sedimentary
association
named
the
Seival
Association
by
Chemale
Jr.
et
al.
(
1995
)
,
which
occurs
outside
of
the
area
represented
in
Fig.
2
.
Known
ages
are
ca
753
Ma
by
Machado
et
al.
(
1990
)
for
the
Vacacaı́
Group
(
Campestre
Formation
)
and
ca
704
Ma
by
Babinski
et
al.
(
1996
)
for
the
Cambaı́
Complex
gneisses
,
both
using
conventional
zircon
U/Pb
geochronology
.
The
Seival
Association
straddles
the
Precambrian/Cambrian
boundary
(
Gresse
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
The
local
andesitic
rocks
are
mostly
of
pyroclastic
origin
and
have
chemical
compositions
rather
similar
to
those
of
modern
arcs
.
The
rocks
are
calc
alkaline
,
low-K
and
low-Nb
(
Koppe
and
Hartmann
,
1988
)
,
have
a
positive
εNd
at
750
Ma
and
model
ages
(
T
DM
)
younger
than
900
Ma
(
Babinski
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
These
seem
to
define
an
old
(
Neoproterozoic
)
fragmented
,
subduction-related
arc
,
which
is
here
informally
termed
the
Bossoroca
Volcanic
Arc
.
The
gold
mineralisation
occurs
in
the
Campestre
Formation
,
which
is
made
up
of
interlayered
intermediate
to
acid
flows
(
rare
)
,
coarse
to
fine-grained
tuffs
(
abundant
)
,
lapilli
tuffs
,
crystal
tuffs
,
conglomerates
,
sandstones
,
pelites
and
minor
chert
and
iron
formation
.
Intermediate
to
acid
compositions
predominate
,
but
some
basaltic
rocks
also
occur
.
The
magmatism
is
typically
low-K
calc-alkaline
(
Koppe
and
Hartmann
,
1988
)
.
The
Cerro
do
Ouro
Formation
occurs
on
the
western
side
of
the
Campestre
Formation
(
Fig.
2
)
,
and
contains
abundant
serpentinite
and
magnesian
schist
bodies
interleaved
with
basalts
,
iron
formations
and
cherts
.
It
may
be
an
ophiolite
(
Wildner
,
1990
)
,
but
the
abundance
of
mafic
–
ultramafic
volcanic
rocks
and
the
komatiitic
geochemical
affinity
of
this
and
regional
related
ultramafic
units
(
Zarpelon
,
1986
,
Remus
,
1990
,
Koppe
,
1990
and
Remus
et
al.
,
1993
)
is
more
typical
of
a
Paleoproterozoic
greenstone
belt
(
sensu
Condie
,
1997
)
which
comprises
remnants
blocks
in
the
Neoproterozoic
juvenile
volcanic
arc
.
The
overall
structure
of
the
rocks
trends
NE
and
dips
50
°
to
the
NW
,
and
was
probably
formed
by
the
thrusting
component
of
a
transpressive
system
.
According
to
field
observations
,
the
Cambaı́
Complex
gneisses
were
thrust
over
the
Cerro
do
Ouro
Formation
,
and
both
thrusted
over
the
Campestre
Formation
.
A
regional
metamorphic
event
is
associated
with
the
thrusting
and
varies
from
greenschist
to
middle
amphibolite
facies
,
with
lower
grade
in
the
eastern
part
and
higher
grade
in
the
western
part
of
the
area
(
Fig.
2
)
.
The
structural
evidence
for
thrusting
is
better
developed
in
the
Palma
region
,
to
the
south
of
the
mapped
area
.
The
Campestre
Formation
is
typically
altered
to
greenschist
metamorphic
grade
,
but
in
the
Bossoroca
deposit
,
the
metamorphic
grade
reaches
the
transition
to
the
amphibolite
facies
,
with
formation
of
hornblende
in
mafic
schists
as
determined
by
electron
microprobe
analyses
(
Koppe
,
1990
)
.
Deformation
of
the
volcanic
sequence
was
not
very
intense
.
The
S1
schistosity
or
slaty
cleavage
,
and
the
brittle
S2
fracturing
,
overprinted
,
but
did
not
obliterate
,
the
sedimentary
and
volcanic
characteristics
of
the
rock
pile
.
In
low
strain
domains
,
the
original
fabrics
of
pyroclastic
and
epiclastic
protoliths
are
very
well
preserved
.
The
S1
foliation
trends
to
the
NE
and
dips
to
the
NW
.
Local
transposition
of
foliation
is
associated
with
the
main
D1
progressive
deformation
episode
.
Brittle
–
ductile
transcurrent
shear
zones
concordant
with
the
schistosity
formed
late
in
the
D1
episode
.
Low-pressure
type
,
regional
dynamothermal
metamorphism
in
mafic/intermediate
rocks
of
the
Campestre
Formation
produced
quartz
+
chlorite
+
white
mica
+
albite
+
epidote
+
calcite
assemblages
in
lower
grade
and
quartz
+
albite
+
biotite
+
hornblende
in
higher
grade
rocks
.
In
metapelites
,
the
paragenesis
is
:
quartz
+
muscovite
+
chlorite
+
andalusite
and
quartz
+
muscovite
+
biotite
+
albite
(
Zarpelon
,
1986
,
Wildner
,
1990
and
Koppe
,
1990
)
.
In
the
Bossoroca
deposit
,
gold
occurs
as
free
gold
and
Au-pyrite
inclusions
in
quartz
veins
of
variable
thicknesses
.
The
quartz
veins
reach
up
to
1
m
in
thickness
,
but
are
normally
around
0.3
m
thick
,
while
,
in
the
nearby
Cerrito
do
Ouro
deposit
,
the
quartz
veins
are
up
to
3
m
thick
.
Veining
is
subparallel
to
the
S1
schistosity
,
but
it
locally
crosscuts
the
foliation
at
low
angle
.
Veins
are
deformed
by
the
D1
episode
.
These
relationships
suggest
that
quartz
vein-related
mineralisation
in
the
area
was
late
to
syn
the
D1
episode
.
Some
late
quartz
veins
and
veinlets
are
oblique
,
or
perpendicular
,
to
S1
,
suggesting
a
later
generation
of
extensional
fracturing
.
The
gold
occurs
between
crystals
of
quartz
,
calcite
and
sulfide
and
subordinately
as
inclusions
or
as
part
of
the
pyrite
structure
.
Free
gold
is
also
present
in
many
small
quartz
veinlets
over
the
entire
area
of
the
volcanic
arc
.
The
São
Sepé
and
two
other
related
granite
plutons
are
intrusive
into
the
volcano-sedimentary
arc
(
Fig.
2
)
,
and
produce
metamorphic
contact
aureoles
superimposed
on
low-grade
regional
metamorphism
.
Metapelites
close
to
the
São
Sepé
Granite
contact
are
transformed
into
andalusite
+
staurolite
+
biotite
+
plagioclase
+
quartz
(
+
cordierite
+
almandine
garnet
)
hornfels
.

Methodology
Geological
field
mapping
was
carried
out
over
the
entire
volcanic
arc
at
the
1:50,000
scale
but
a
more
detailed
1:5,000
survey
was
performed
on
the
area
close
to
the
mine
(
Fig.
2
)
.
The
mine
itself
was
surveyed
at
the
1:500
scale
in
several
levels
as
stripping
progressed
(
Koppe
,
1990
)
.
Structural
controls
were
established
and
rock
and
ore
samples
collected
for
laboratory
studies
.
Approximately
five
hundred
thin
sections
of
the
entire
volcanic
arc
were
studied
,
followed
by
rock
geochemistry
and
electron
microprobe
analyses
of
minerals
(
Koppe
and
Hartmann
,
1988
and
Koppe
,
1990
)
.
For
the
present
investigation
,
rock
samples
were
collected
from
the
mine
pit
and
from
the
São
Sepé
Granite
.
Samples
weighing
1
kg
were
collected
for
Pb
isotopic
studies
,
and
about
40
kg
of
a
dacitic
crystal
tuff
from
the
mine
pit
were
collected
for
zircon
studies
,
because
the
rock
is
poor
in
this
mineral
.
Only
5
kg
of
granite
were
necessary
for
zircon
separation
.
Feldspars
were
separated
from
the
dacite
and
granites
by
conventional
magnetic
and
heavy
liquid
procedures
.
Ore
sulfides
were
collected
in
the
mine
pit
for
sulfide
Pb-isotope
studies
;
individual
sulfides
were
separated
by
hand
picking
.
Zircon
geochronology
was
undertaken
in
one
sample
to
determine
the
age
of
the
host
dacite
rock
from
the
Campestre
Formation
.
SHRIMP
investigations
of
zircons
were
undertaken
at
Curtin
University
and
follow
the
procedures
of
Compston
et
al.
,
1984
and
Smith
et
al.
,
1998
.
Scanning
electron
microscope
images
of
grains
to
be
analysed
were
obtained
using
backscattered
electron
(
BSE
)
and
cathodoluminescence
(
CL
)
modes
at
the
Centre
for
Microscopy
and
Microanalysis
,
University
of
Western
Australia
.
The
dacite
contained
few
zircons
:
only
twenty-nine
crystals
were
obtained
and
analysed
from
40
kg
of
rock
.
Rock
samples
for
isotopic
analysis
were
crushed
and
milled
in
an
agate
mortar
to
minimise
any
contamination
.
Lead
was
extracted
by
ion
exchange
chromatography
at
the
Lead-free
Laboratory
,
University
of
Western
Australia
,
and
the
isotopic
measurements
were
made
on
a
VG354
multicollector
mass
spectrometer
housed
at
Curtin
University
.

Shrimp
zircon
U/Pb
studies
The
wall-rock
dacite
from
the
open
pit
contains
three
morphological
zircon
types
.
The
largest
population
is
made
up
of
small
short
prismatic
,
colourless
,
angular
,
commonly
broken
crystals
.
BSE/CL
images
(
Fig.
3
)
reveal
an
internal
igneous
texture
of
oscillatory
and
sector
zoning
,
most
visible
in
the
CL
images
.
Oscilatory
zoning
is
common
in
this
population
(
Fig.
3A
,
3A1
)
.
Sixteen
analyses
on
fifteen
crystals
of
this
type
(
Table
1
)
are
analytically
indistinguishable
from
each
other
and
show
a
206
Pb
/
238
U
age
of
757
±
17
Ma
(
Fig.
4
)
.
The
U
and
Th
contents
of
the
zircons
are
low
(
Table
1
,
Fig.
5
)
,
and
Th/U
ratios
vary
from
0.2
to
0.5
,
which
are
typical
of
igneous
zircons
.
The
age
of
ca
757
Ma
is
considered
to
be
the
magmatic
age
of
the
volcanic
rock
,
and
it
is
in
agreement
with
the
conventional
U/Pb
zircon
age
determination
of
753
±
2
Ma
obtained
by
Machado
et
al.
(
1990
)
for
a
rhyolite
from
the
Campestre
Formation
(
Fig.
2
)
.
A
few
crystals
yield
the
same
age
(
ca
757
Ma
)
on
cores
and
rims
(
e.g.
,
Fig.
3A
)
,
corresponding
to
the
magmatic
age
.
A
special
problem
is
encountered
in
four
spots
which
yield
ages
around
800
Ma
;
these
could
be
within
analytical
error
of
the
757
Ma
event
or
else
be
inherited
cores
.
In
crystal
31
(
Table
1
)
,
the
core
is
816
Ma
and
the
rim
788
Ma
.
This
means
that
the
core
contains
inherited
lead
,
although
there
are
no
special
textural
features
on
BSE/CL
images
.
As
a
consequence
,
spots
31-2
,
30-1
,
15-1
and
33-1
are
not
included
in
the
calculation
of
the
average
magmatic
age
.
Two
zircon
crystals
display
external
forms
similar
to
the
first
group
,
but
the
internal
structure
shows
a
core
which
is
discordant
to
,
and
partly
overgrows
,
the
euhedral
internal
zoning
(
Fig.
3C
,
3C1
)
.
An
equivalent
textural
relationship
of
younger
cores
was
recognised
by
Gebauer
(
1996
,
p.
312
)
;
this
is
also
similar
to
the
internal
growth
textures
formed
by
fracture
sealing
,
as
described
by
Hartmann
et
al.
(
1997
)
.
The
206
Pb
/
238
U
age
of
this
zircon
growth
is
699
±
15
Ma
,
which
coincides
with
the
conventional
U/Pb
zircon
age
determination
of
704
±
13
Ma
on
a
syntectonic
diorite
from
the
nearby
Cambaı́
Complex
(
Babinski
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
This
ca
700
Ma
age
is
considered
to
be
the
age
of
the
M1
metamorphic
event
affecting
the
Bossoroca
Arc
.
One
inherited
crystal
was
identified
;
it
is
clear
and
shows
no
internal
zoning
;
the
rounding
probably
indicates
sedimentary
recycling
(
Fig.
3D
)
.
The
206
Pb
/
238
U
age
obtained
is
1023
±
22
Ma
and
agrees
very
well
with
previous
conventional
U/Pb
dating
of
inherited
zircon
from
a
nearby
rhyolite
by
Machado
et
al.
(
1990
)
(
Fig.
4
and
Fig.
5
)
.
Four
spot
analyses
have
high
common
lead
(
Table
1
)
and
have
the
same
textural
features
as
the
magmatic
population
.
Another
group
,
which
gives
ages
younger
than
the
metamorphic
event
,
is
interpreted
as
a
lead-loss
group
.
These
zircons
lost
lead
,
possibly
due
to
incipient
metamictization
in
higher
U
(
about
900
ppm
)
spots
and
to
solutions
migrating
through
fractures
.
The
São
Sepé
Granite
has
two
main
textural
facies
,
as
characterised
by
field
mapping
,
petrography
and
geochemistry
(
Sartori
and
Rüegg
,
1979
;
Gastal
et
al.
,
1995
)
.
Zircons
from
two
samples
of
the
different
granite
facies
were
studied
using
the
SHRIMP
.
The
preliminary
zircon
date
from
this
and
another
granite
plutons
of
the
São
Gabriel
Block
were
previously
presented
by
Remus
et
al.
(
1997
)
.
The
monzogranite
facies
located
in
the
northern
part
of
pluton
has
a
single
zircon
population
with
a
206
Pb
/
238
U
age
of
558
±
8
Ma
(
Table
2
)
.
The
magmatic
zircon
population
is
made
up
of
yellowish
to
colourless
euhedral
prismatic
and
short
prismatic
crystals
with
{
100
}
and
{
010
}
symmetric
well-developed
faces
.
BSE
and
CL
images
reveal
an
internal
texture
of
massive
,
complex
or
oscillatory
zoned
cores
and
oscillatory
zoned
rims
(
Figs.
6A
and
B
)
,
which
contain
inclusions
of
very
small
long
prismatic
black
and
colorless
minerals
.
The
age
of
cores
and
rims
of
analysed
zircons
are
analytically
indistinguishable
(
Fig.
6A
)
.
The
younger
grains
show
the
same
texture
as
the
main
magmatic
population
.
These
zircons
lost
lead
due
to
modern
weathering
or
contain
high
common
lead
(
Fig.
7
,
Table
2
)
.
The
sample
from
the
microgranite
facies
was
collected
from
a
quarry
at
the
SE
edge
of
the
pluton
,
and
has
only
one
distinctive
magmatic
zircon
population
.
It
is
represented
by
colourless
and
yellowish
grains
of
prismatic
and
short
prismatic
zircons
with
symmetrical
and
asymmetrical
{
101
}
and
{
110
}
pyramid
faces
,
and
has
a
206
Pb
/
238
U
age
of
550
±
6
Ma
(
Fig.
8
and
Table
3
)
which
is
interpreted
as
the
magmatic
age
of
this
granite
border
facies
.
BSE
and
CL
images
show
an
internal
texture
of
massive
or
oscillatory
and
,
rarely
,
complex
zoned
cores
.
Oscillatory
zoning
is
visible
especially
in
the
rims
of
grains
(
Figs.
6C
,
D
)
.
The
discordant
Th
–
U
–
Pb
zircon
group
and
high
common
Pb
group
(
Fig.
8
)
have
the
same
morphologic
characteristics
as
the
magmatic
population
.
A
value
of
εNd
of
−
10
for
the
microgranite
facies
,
and
a
model
age
(
T
DM
)
of
2.3
Ga
,
indicate
its
derivation
from
ancient
crustal
rocks
(
Remus
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
Older
zircon
xenocrysts
are
absent
in
this
granite
,
and
this
may
be
due
to
the
high
temperature
of
the
magma
,
which
is
likely
to
have
caused
complete
dissolution
of
older
zircons
derived
from
the
basement
rocks
of
the
granite
source
region
.
This
evidence
,
and
Pb
and
Nd
isotopic
data
,
indicate
an
old
crustal
source
origin
(
possibly
granulites
)
for
the
granite
which
is
compared
to
A-type
granites
and
agrees
well
with
previous
geochemical
classification
(
Gastal
et
al.
,
1995
)
.

.
Fluids
Fluid
inclusion
studies
in
quartz
veins
by
Koppe
(
1990
)
indicate
an
average
temperature
of
gold
deposition
of
247
°
C
and
a
lithostatic
pressure
ranging
from
500
to
1300
bars
.
The
fluid
composition
is
represented
by
the
H
2
O
–
CO
2
system
with
low
salinity
(
about
1
%
NaCl
equiv
.
)
and
average
density
of
0.82
g/cm
3
.
δ
13
C
values
for
gangue
calcite
are
between
−
5.6
and
−
8.2
‰
PDB
(
n
=
8
)
,
whereas
δ
18
O
values
fall
between
+15
and
+16.7
‰
SMOW
(
n
=
8
)
.
This
indicates
a
homogeneous
fluid
and
stable
conditions
of
temperature
and
pressure
during
mineralisation
.
The
data
suggest
that
the
ore
fluid
was
a
deeply
derived
fluid
(
Groves
et
al.
,
1992
)
.
Fluids
probably
ascended
through
regional
shear
zone
structures
and
reached
the
registered
transitional
greenschist/amphibolite
facies
position
in
the
upper
crust
(
Koppe
,
1990
)
.

.
Lead
isotopes
and
source
of
mineralisation
Lead
isotopic
analyses
were
performed
on
several
minerals
and
rocks
in
order
to
assess
the
source
of
Pb
in
the
mineralising
system
.
Galenas
from
the
main
gold-quartz
vein
in
the
Bossoroca
Mine
pit
were
analysed
.
Analyses
were
also
done
on
plagioclase
and
whole-rock
samples
from
the
wall-rock
dacite
,
and
also
on
K-feldspars
from
two
facies
of
the
São
Sepé
Granite
.
The
feldspars
were
separated
and
analysed
because
their
low
U/Pb
allowed
the
Pb
isotope
composition
to
better
reflect
the
initial
Pb
in
the
granites
(
e.g.
,
McNaughton
and
Bickle
,
1987
)
.
The
lead
isotopic
data
are
presented
in
Table
4
,
and
shown
on
a
common
lead
diagram
in
Fig.
9
.
The
plagioclase
and
two
volcanic
samples
plot
on
a
Pb
–
Pb
isochron
compatible
with
a
ca
750
Ma
age
of
igneous
crystallisation
,
as
determined
by
SHRIMP
.
The
third
sample
plots
off
the
isochron
,
probably
because
it
is
more
altered
and
enriched
in
tourmaline
(
∼
2
wt
%
)
.
The
galena
data
,
which
are
considered
the
best
estimates
of
the
initial
Pb
composition
in
the
ore
system
,
are
isotopically
homogeneous
and
also
plot
on
the
ca
750
Ma
reference
isochron
.
Although
the
galena
–
plagioclase
–
metadacite
array
of
data
could
be
interpreted
as
galena
formation
shortly
after
volcanism
,
the
slope
of
the
reference
isochron
is
relatively
insensitive
to
age
.
The
quartz
vein-related
mineralisation
is
considered
to
be
late
in
the
D1-M1
episode
at
ca
700
Ma
,
based
on
field
observations
.
This
is
the
suggested
age
of
deposition
of
gold
in
the
Bossoroca
Mine
.
The
deposits
in
the
area
appear
to
be
restricted
to
the
750
–
700
Ma
interval
.
The
Pb
isotope
data
are
compatible
with
the
timing
constraints
.
Further
,
the
Pb
in
galenas
from
the
Bossoroca
deposit
is
also
compatible
with
derivation
solely
from
the
host
metadacites
at
ca
700
Ma
.
Lead
isotopic
data
for
K-feldspars
from
the
border
facies
and
core
facies
of
the
São
Sepé
granitic
rocks
are
shown
in
Fig.
9
.
The
average
of
the
least
radiogenic
Pb
from
K-feldspars
from
each
facies
of
the
granite
is
the
best
estimate
for
the
initial
Pb
isotopic
compositions
of
the
magma
.
These
compositions
for
the
two
facies
are
similar
to
each
other
,
but
distinctly
more
primitive
than
the
galena
data
(
Fig.
9
)
.
This
large
contrast
in
Pb
isotopic
composition
is
distinctive
.
Thus
,
a
granite
of
similar
isotopic
characteristics
and
age
to
the
São
Sepé
Granite
could
not
have
contributed
Pb
to
the
mineralising
fluid
.
Even
a
small
contribution
would
have
caused
the
galena
data
to
fall
below
the
750
Ma
reference
isochron
in
Fig.
9
.
The
Pb
isotope
data
show
that
the
ore
fluids
in
the
Bossoroca
gold
deposit
were
probably
derived
from
the
host
terrane
or
the
source
rock
of
host
terrane
.
The
structural
timing
of
mineralisation
was
late
in
the
metamorphic
cycle
,
and
this
deposit
is
considered
to
be
an
epizonal
orogenic
gold
deposit
in
the
sense
of
Groves
et
al.
(
1998
)
.
It
is
inferred
that
metals
were
mobilised
by
fluids
ascending
through
the
Campestre
Formation
volcanic
pile
.
These
ascending
fluids
scavenged
lead
and
gold
to
deposit
the
metals
in
structurally
controlled
sites
higher
in
the
crust
.
Also
,
the
metals
could
be
derived
from
the
same
deep
source
region
of
volcanic
rocks
of
Campestre
Formation
.
The
main
source
of
fluids
most
probably
was
the
deeper
crust
.

Conclusions
SHRIMP
U/Pb
dating
of
zircons
from
dacitic
wall-rocks
of
the
Campestre
Formation
,
which
host
the
Bossoroca
lode-gold
deposit
,
yields
an
age
of
757
±
17
Ma
for
volcanism
which
formed
this
part
of
the
juvenile
island
arc
.
The
age
of
the
peak
of
metamorphism
for
the
Campestre
Formation
is
estimated
to
be
ca
700
Ma
,
based
on
SHRIMP
age
data
on
757
Ma
zircons
which
show
textural
re-equilibration
.
The
structural
timing
of
the
ores
is
compatible
with
the
younger
age
,
which
is
also
the
age
of
mineralisation
.
Lead
isotope
evidence
suggests
that
the
Pb
in
the
ore
fluid
was
derived
from
the
host
Campestre
Formation
or
its
source
region
.
The
São
Sepé
Granite
intruded
the
volcanic
arc
at
ca
550
Ma
and
caused
a
marked
metamorphic
contact
aureole
on
rocks
of
the
Campestre
Formation
.
However
,
the
initial
Pb
composition
of
granite
samples
is
markedly
different
from
the
initial
Pb
of
the
Bossoroca
ore
,
showing
that
the
granite
,
or
a
related
magma
at
depth
,
could
not
be
the
source
of
the
metals
in
the
gold
deposit
.
This
study
indicates
that
metals
concentrated
in
the
Bossoroca
lode-gold
deposit
were
mobilised
during
regional
dynamothermal
metamorphism
by
deeply
derived
fluids
that
ascended
through
the
volcano/sedimentary
Campestre
Formation
,
scavenged
lead
and
gold
,
and
later
deposited
the
metals
in
structurally
controlled
sites
at
higher
crustal
levels
.
Also
the
metals
could
be
derived
from
the
same
deep
source
region
of
volcanic
rocks
of
Campestre
Formation
.
The
O-C
stable
isotope
evidence
is
compatible
with
a
deeply
derived
ore
fluid
.
