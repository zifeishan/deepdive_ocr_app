Abstract
A
Ivide
range
of
selective
pressures
have
been
advanced
as
possible
causes
lor
the
adoption
of
bipedalism
in
the
hominin
lineage.
One
suggestion
has
been
that
because
modern
human
Ivalking
is
relatively
eNcient
compared
to
that
ola
typical
quadruped,
the
ancestral
quadruped
may
have
reaped
an
energetic
advantage
Ivhen
it
Ivalked
on
two
legs.
While
it
has
become
clear
that
human
walking
is
relatively
eNcient
and
human
running
ineNcient
compared
to
'generalized
endotherms",

their
opinion
of
horv
the
cost
of
human
bipedal
locomotion
compares
to
that
ola
generalized
primate
walking
quadrupedally.
One
vierv
is
that
human
walking
is
particularly
eNcient
in
comparison
to
other
primates.
The
present
study
addresses
this
by
comparing
the
cost
ol
human
Ivalking
and
running
to
that
ol
the
eight
primate
species
for
Ivhich
data
are
available
and
by
comparing
cost
in
primates
to
that
ola
'generalized
endotherm'.
There
is
no
evidence
that
primate
locomotion
is
more
costly
than
that
of
a
generalized
endotherm,
although
more
data
on
adult
Old
World
monkeys
and
apes
would
be
useful.
Further,
human
locomotion
does
not
appear
to
be
particularly
eNcient
relative
to
that
of
other
primates.

and

(See
Rose,
1991,
for
an
excellent
review.)
The
present
study
contributes
to
the
discussion
of
whether
selection
for
energetic
efficiency
was
an
important
factor
in
the
origin
of
bipedality.
It
has
become
clear
that
human
walking
is
inexpensive
and
human
running
is
usually
expen-
sive
compared
to
that
of
a
typical
quadruped
(Steudel,
1994,
1996).
There
is,
however,
no
con-
sensus
on
the
efficiency
of
human
locomotion
compared
to
that
of
other
primates.
Rodman
and
McHenry
(1980)
compared
the
cost
of
human
walking
to
that
of
chimpanzees
and
concluded
that
human
walking
is
considerably
cheaper.
Jablonski
and
Chaplin
(1993),
on
the
other
hand,
looked
at
the
cost
of
human
locomotion
compared
to
that
of
the
patas
monkey
and
concluded
that
"no
special
advantage
can
be
identified
for
human
bipedalism
over
primate
quadrupedalism."
Leonard
and
Robertson
(1997,
2001)
have
argued
that
human
bipedalism
is
efficient
relative
to
the
quadrupedal-
ism
of
primates
generally
based
on
the
primate
cost
equation
developed
by
Taylor
et
al.
(1982).
The
present
study
addresses
the
energetics
of
human
locomotion
based
on
a
variety
of
studies
and
puts
it
in
the
context
of
a
broad
sample
of
primates
and
of
birds
and
mammals
to
attempt
to
clarify
this
discussion.
The
cost
of
locomotion
in
primates
is
also
compared
to
that
of
"generalized
endotherms".
The
data
The
data
on
which
these
discussions
are
based
are
measurements
of
the
energetic
cost
of
loco-
motion
in
a
variety
of
mammals.
Because
ongoing
submaximal
locomotion
is
usually
powered
almost
entirely
by
ATP
generated
by
aerobic
pathways,
experimenters
measure
the
rate
of
oxygen
con-
sumed
by
a
subject
under
a
variety
of
locomotor
conditions,
usually
on
a
treadmill.
Often
the
cost
of
a
given
locomotor
activity
is
simply
reported
in
milliliters
of
oxygen,
or
converted
to
Joules
or
kilocalories.
The
cost
of
an
activity
can
be
expressed
as
a
rate,
called
the
"cost
of
locomotion"
the
cost
to
engage
in
the
activity
for
a
particular
amount
of
time.
Other
authors
focus
instead
on
the
cost
to
travel
a
particular
distance
called
the
"cost
of
transport".
It
has
been
demon-
strated
that
the
amount
of
energy
that
an
animal
consumes
in
traveling
is
highly
dependent
on
its
mass
(e.g.
Taylor
et
al.,
1982).
While
larger
animals
expend
a
greater
total
number
of
calories
because
they
are
doing
more
work
(moving
a
greater
mass),
the
cost
per
kilogram
of
body
mass
is
typically
smaller
in
a
larger
animal
and
this
reduction
has
been
well
documented
(e.g.
Taylor
et
al.,
1982).
Because
body
mass
is
rarely
a
con-
stant
in
most
interesting
comparisons
of
loco-
motor
energetics,
nearly
all
studies
involving
comparisons
of
locomotor
costs
have
reported
the
cost
per
kilogram.
The
baseline
expectation
for
the
cost
of
loco-
motion
or
cost
of
transport
are
based
on
data
on
62
mammalian
and
avian
species,
including
eight
primate
species,
summarized
by
Taylor
et
al.
(1982).
The
equations
describing
the
relationship
between
cost
and
speed
for
each
species
are
pre-
sented
in
their
Table
1.
They
also
developed
a
general
equation
(their
Eq.
(9))
summarizing
the
relationship
of
energetic
cost
of
locomotion
in
relation
to
speed
and
body
mass
across
their
entire
sample
that
I
use
here.
I
will
refer
to
predictions
from
this
equation
as
being
for
the
generalized
endotherm.
The
available
primate
data
are
from
a
variety
of
sources
(Taylor
and
Rowntree,
1973;
Parsons
and
Taylor,
1977;
Mahoney,
1980;
Taylor
et
al.,
1982).
Values
for
human
locomotion
were
obtained
from
a
variety
of
studies
and
graphed
individually
to
allow
an
evaluation
of
consistency.
Only
estimates
of
cost
from
studies
whose
designs
produced
steady-state
values
at
a
variety
of
speeds
and
where
subject
mass
was
taken
into
account
were
chosen.
Publications
combining
results
from
a
variety
of
previously
published
works
were
excluded.
I
included
some
of
the
older
classic
publications,
particularly

cited
in

on

Nakatsukasa

report

this
may

for

though
the

of
this

be
dependent

how

In
an
attempt
to
evaluate
whether
locomotor
costs
had
been
measured
on
adult
or
immature
specimens,
I
have
compared
the
masses
of
the

were

to
size
estimates

these

All

on
which
locomotor

were
measured
were
substantially
smaller
than
the

documented
adult
females
in

suggesting
that
they
must

been
