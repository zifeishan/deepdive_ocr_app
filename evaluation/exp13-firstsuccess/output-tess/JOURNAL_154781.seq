In
this
paper
two
samples
from
Reed
’s
Cave
in
the
Black
Hills
of
South
Dakota
with
discordant
but
coeval
growth
are
examined
to
show
that
within
a
cave
different
models
may
be
necessary
for
interpreting
isotopic
change
.
The
relationship
between
the
speleothem
isotope
record
and
climate
may
change
over
time
because
of
sensitivity
to
local
conditions
.
The
variability
of
isotopic
composition
at
different
drip
sites
within
a
cave
can
offer
different
,
but
still
useful
,
isotope
records
that
can
be
used
as
paleoclimate
proxies
.
Application
of
spectral

to
the
oxygen

has
revealed
millennial

variability
in
both
Reed

speleothems
described
below
.
Comparison
of
their

to

conﬁrm
that

are
being
recorded
by

The

)
in
the
Black
Hills
of
South
Dakota
(
Fig.

)
.
The
Black
Hills
are
a
dissected
dome
exposing
a
sequence
of
sedimentary
rocks
with
signiﬁcant
cave
development
in
the
Mississippian
limestones
(
Palmer
and
Palmer
,
1989
)
.
Nearby
Jewel
and
Wind
Caves
are
two
of
the
longest
cave
systems
in
the
world
but
contain
few
vadose
speleothems
formed
by
drip
waters
because
they
are
largely
covered
by
impermeable
clastic
strata
(
Bakalowicz
et
al.
,
1987
)
.
Reed
’s
Cave
is
at
shallow
depth
because
the
cover
and
upper
limestone
has
been
eroded
,
permitting
signiﬁcant
amounts
of
speleothem
deposition
from
vadose
dripwaters
,
some
of
which
are
actively
depositing
today
.
Part
of
the
cave
underlies
a
quarry
that
has
been
active
for
the
past
20
years
.
The
blasting
activities
have
dislodged
hundreds
of
speleothems
,
enabling
us
to
remove
samples
without
destroying
any
intact
specimens
.
The
modern
vegetation
overlying
the
cave
system
is
a
mixed
—
grass
prairie
and
hardwood
forest
.
The
boundary
between
these
two
habitats
may
have
shifted
back
and
forth
during
the
late
Quaternary
(
Dorale
et
al.
,
1992
)
.
The
average
annual
surface
temperature
is
8
°
C
and
the
range
between
winter
and
summer
average
temperature
is
28
°
C.
Average
annual
precipitation
is
783
mm
with
476
mm
from
rain
and
307
mm
(
water
equivalent
)
from
snow
.
Seasonality
is
seen
in
more
active
inﬁltration
and
dripping
during
the
cooler
seasons
.
Theoretical
losses
in

Calcite

analysis
were
drilled
out
using
0.8

mm
and
0.4
mm
cobalt

.
The

,
approximately

were
run

attached
to
an
Optima

Dripwaters
were
collected
as
spot
samples
,
with
some
of
the
slower
dripping
sites
left
overnight
.
Their
8180
values
were
determined
by
equilibration
of
water
with
CO2
at
25
°
C
for
24

.
The

Results

The

for
the
oxygen
isotope
records
were
obtained
using
the
program
SPECTRUM
Sereﬁddin
(
Schulz
and

,

.
This
program
was
created
for
unevenly
spaced

series
like
speleothem
data
that
exhibit
distinctly
different
periods
of
growth
.

Relationships
between
climate
and
speleothem
records
Oxygen
isotope
variations
in
speleothem
calcite
can
be
used
as
a
paleoclimate
proxy
if
these
deposits
were
formed
in
oxygen
isotope
equilibrium
with
formation
waters
(
Schwarcz
,
1986
)
.
Equilibrium
conditions
occur
when
there
is
slow
deposition
of
calcite
from
the
drip
water
.
Rapid
degassing
of
CO2
or
evaporation
of
drip
water
causes
kinetic
fractionation
effects
that
can
obscure
the
climate
signal
.
For
this
study
,
three
growth
layers
in
each
speleothem
were
used
for
the
equilibrium
test
,
i.e.
that
818001
is
uniform
along
the
layer
(
Hendy
,
1971
)
.
No
covariance
in
oxygen
and
carbon
isotopes
along
the
growth
layers
was
found
and
there
was
almost
no
enrichment
of
180
towards
the
edges
of
the
growth
layers
,
indicating
that
there
was
equilibrium
deposition
.
One
growth
layer
in
speleothem
RC20
shows
some
enrichment
towards
the
edge
.
However
,
the
growth
layers
in
these
speleothems
are
very
difﬁ
—
cult
to
differentiate
along
their
outer
portions
(
Fig.
2a
,
b
)
,
with
the
consequence
that
individual
values
for
5180
“
may
be
averaging
thousands
of
years
of
growth
.
There
is
also
the
possibility
that
the
sample
locations
are
capturing
different
time
slices
.
We
have
also
attempted
to
determine
the
suitability
of
the
samples
by
comparing
them
with
other
proxy
records
including
other
speleothems
.
If
a
speleothem
grows
in
oxygen
isotope
equilibrium
with
drip
waters
,
then
variations
in
8180
of
the
calcite
(
AS1800
)
are
governed
by
the
equat1on
:

(

(

which
relates
changes

‘
to
the
temperature

changes
in
fractionation
between
calcite
and
water
(
occkw
)

precipitation
(
8
‘
8Op
)
and
to
changes
in
global
ice
volume
as
reﬂected
in

SIBOSW
.
The
three
components
of
this
equation
are
deﬁned
by
relationships
determined
from
experimental
and
empirical
studies
.
The

An
additional
complicating
factor
is
the
source
and
movement
of
storm
tracks
over
the
continent
at
different
times
in
the
past
.
Future
analyses
of

of
this

the

(

.
One
ﬁnal
consideration
when
evaluating
the
8180
of
calcite
is
the
effect
of
the
isotopic
composition
of
seawater
on
global
meteoric
water
composition
.
We
can
estimate
that
A
(
518Osw
)
1.2
%
o
for
glacial
to
interglacial
transition
as
a
result
of
accumulation
of
lighter
oxygen
isotopes
in
ice
sheets
and
the
enrichment
of
heavy
isotopes
in
seawater
as
temperature
decreased
(
Lea
al.
,
2000
;
Fairbanks
,
1989
)
.
The
composition
of
precipitation
falling
on
the
continents
is
directly
affected
by
this
factor
because
seawater
is
the
principal
source
of
the
moisture
.
The
net
result
of
these
competing
effects
on
818001
may
vary
signiﬁcantly
between
caves
,
with
the
result
that
the
net
effect
of
decreasing
Table
1
temperature
at
a
site
can
be
either
an
increase
or
decrease
in
818001
.
The
general
sense
of
isotopic
change
in
response
to
climate
change
at
a
site
can
be
determined
by
comparison
of
ice
—
age
deposits
with
modern
speleothem
forming
at
the
same
site
.
As
we
shall
see
,
other
effects
can
also
lead
to
a
difference
in
the
temperature
dependence
of
8180
“
at

locations

This
could
indicate
an
increase

dripwater
and/or
a
period
of
increased
precipitation
just
prior
to
the

For

(

.
This
is
strong
evidence
that
different
drip
sites
within
a
cave
can
be
responding
to
different
drip
water
pathways
or
changes
in
catchment
area
,
which
,
as
will
be
shown
,
can
result
in
variable

records

.
Oxygen
isotopes
A
useful
tool
for
interpreting
oxygen
isotope
variations
is
to
determine
how
the
51806
‘
changes
with
temperature
.
This
can
be
done
in
two
ways
.
First
,
we
can
compare
8180
“
formed
in
colder
periods
to
the
8180
“
of
modern
(
interglacial
)
calcite
forming
in
the
cave
today
.
Second
,
we
can
observe
the
trend
in
51800
,
with
time
during
a
transition
from
glacial
to
interglacial
climate
(
as
inferred
by
comparison
with
deep
—
sea
cores
or
other
global
records
)
.
From
these
comparisons
we
can
estimate
the
sign
of
d
(
518Oc
[
)
/
a
’
T
which
we
will
refer
to
as
gamma
(
y
)
.
Dripwaters

in

This
is
in
agreement
with
measured
values
of
approximately
-10
to
-14
%
;
for
8180
of
modern
precipitation
in
this
region
(
IAEA
,
2001
)
.

—
618ow
(
5
)
one
can
calculate
the
temperature
from
measured
518O
of
calcite
and
water
pairs
.
The
fractionation
between
the
calcite
—
water
pairs
is
temperature
dependent
,
thus
temperature
can
be
calculated
if
the
5180
values
are
known
.
The
average
8
‘
8O
for
calcite
—
water
pairs
calculates
to
9.8
i
6
°
C
,
which
agrees
well
with
measured
modern
average
temperature
.
Two
samples
with
more
enriched
8180
of
the
water
cause
this
large
uncertainty
which
is
likely
due
to
airﬂow
introduced
into
the
cave
from
modern
quarrying
activities
.
Without
these
two
samples
the
uncertainty
,
calculated
from
variability
in
8180
of
water
,
is
reduced
to
2.4
°
C
.
We
can
assume
that
the
quarrying
activities
have
signiﬁcantly
changed
the
airﬂow
and
possibly
the
groundwater
pathways
into
the
cave
,
so
the
modern
system
is
not
representing
similar
conditions
.
However
,
at
sites
where
equilibrium
conditions
do
exist
,
we
can
still
compare
calculated
temperatures
to
measured
modern
temperatures
.
Isotopic
measurements
of
four
actively
growing
speleothems
(
soda
straw
stalactites
)
have
a
modern
range
for
8180
“
from
-9
%
o
to
-13.6
%
o
.
The
higher
81800
,
values
are
likely
affected
by
evaporative
fractionation
because
humidity
in
the
cave
may
drop
below
90
%
.
The
more
depleted
values
at
~
-13
%
o
are
more
representative
of
equilibrium
deposits
of
modern
5180a
.
The
reduced
humidity
does
not
appear
to
be
present
during
the

growth

compared
to
more
oscillatory
records
of
the
subsequent
phase
.
However
,
the
amplitude
of
variation
in
the
records
is
similar
.
There
is
a
general
trend
of
increasing
51806
,
values
towards
a
maximum
at
around
55
ooo
years
.
This
trend
takes
place
during
the
transition
from
the
end
of
MIS
5
to
MIS
4
,
a
time
of
cooling
in
climate
over
this
period
,
conﬁrming
that
y
<
o
for
this
speleothem
.
The
most
prominent
feature
of
the
early
part
of
the
record
is
the
positive
shift
in
8180C
,
that
begins
approximately
71000
years
ago
,
which
is
1000
to
3000
years
after
the
start
of
MIS
4
.
In
the
transition
from
MIS
4
to
MIS
3
,
there
is
a
general
decrease
in
51806
,
coupled
with
an
increase
in
growth
rate
and
increase
in
the
amplitude
and
frequency
of
oscillations
in
the
isotopic
records
.
The
second
phase
of
growth
lasted
from
48
500
to
24000
years
ago
.
The
speleothem
ceased
growing
approximately
3000
years
before
the
Late
Glacial
Maximum
(
LGM
)
,
the
oscillations
of
its
8180
signal
increasing
in
intensity
as
the
drip
sites
became
inactive
due
to
colder
temperatures
above
the
cave
.
This
phase
of
growth
covered
most

The

(

This

The
striking
decrease
of
about
-3
%
o
after
59

in
the
RC20

reﬂects

at

The
cooling
marked
in
the
RC20
record
precedes
that
of
Crevice
Cave
by
approximately
5000
years
,
but
this
is
likely
due
to
the
higher
latitude
and
closer
proximity
of
Reed
’s
Cave
to
the
Laurentide

(

)
margin
.
The

over
Reed

respond

to
advances
in
the

Discussion
6.1
.
Intrasite
isotopic
dzﬂerences
When
we
compare
the
two
oxygen
isotope
records
over
the
limited
period
when
both
speleothems
were
being
deposited
,
we
see
a
difference
in
values
of
8180
(
Fig.
6
)
:
the
average
81800
.
value
of
RC2
is
1.4
%
o
greater
than
that
of
RC20
.
The
carbon
isotopes
are
offset
as
well
,
but
the
average
513C
values
of
the
two
samples
only
differ
by
0.4
%
o
(
Fig.
6
)
.
The
different
appearances
of
the
isotope
records
for
the
two
stalagmites
can
be
explained
in
part
by
the
difference
in
growth
rates
and
morphology
.
The
reduced
variability
in
the
early
part
of
RC2
record
is
partly
due
to
the
slower
deposition
rate
from
reduced
calcium
ion
excess
and
our
inability
to
resolve
the
high
—
fre
—
quency
variations
in
8180
and
513C
values
for
these
compact
growth
layers
.
These
two
speleothems
were
deposited
less
than
10
m
apart
far
inside
the
cave
and
will
thus
have
experienced
the
same
temperature
histories
.
Therefore
,
their
differences
in
isotopic
composition
must
be
due
to
differences
in
the
composition
of
the
drip
waters
from
which
they
grew
.
The
higher
growth
rate
for
RC20
may
indicate
a
higher
discharge
rate
or
difference
in
calcium
ion
concentrations
.
Changes
in
calcium
ion
concentration
are
affected
by
soil
—
water
and
rock
—
water
interactions
and
are
not
explicitly
linked
to
changes
in
discharge
.
In
relatively
dry
climates
such
as
that
above
Reed
’s
Cave
,
a
ten
—
fold
or
even
one
hundred
—
fold
increase
of
drip
rate
may
occur
without
equivalent
dilution
of
the
calcium
ion
excess
(
Dreybrodt
and
Buhmann
,
1991
)
.
Changes
in
the
vegetation
cover
can
also
affect
growth
rates
in
speleothems
,
but
it
is
difficult
to
quantify
this
effect
for
Quaternary
age
deposits
.
Lower
residence
time
of
inﬁltration
waters
in
the
vadose
zone
can
reduce
equilibration
of
dissolved
CO2
with
soil
CO2
and
give
higher
813C
values
,
especially
if
rapid
recharge
bypasses
the
soil
zone
altogether
through
ﬁssures
open
to
the
surface
.
Rapid
bypass
can
also
limit
any
evaporation
that
can
take
place
in
the
vadose
zone
which
can
give
increased
5180
values
in
deposited
calcite
(
Amundson
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
This
alone
can
not
account
for
the
difference
in
average
8180
of
the
feed
waters
to
the
two
sites
.
Seasonality
of
water
recharge
can
have
a
large
impact
on
the
average
5180
at
a
particular
drip
site
,
due
to
the
large
seasonal
variation
in
8180p
of
up
to
15
%
o
,
which
is
expected
to
occur
at
sites
in
this
climatic
zone
(
Rozanski
et
al.
,
1993
)
.

lower

RC20
may
be
because
et
et
Dorale
et
and
drip
water
was
biased
to
winter
precipitation
,
e.g.
as
snowmelt
waters
,
while
recharge
to
RC2
was
not
.
Based
on
its
much
higher
growth
rate
,
we
may
also
assume
that
the
drip
rate
at
the
site
of
formation
of
RC20
was
higher
and
therefore
variations
in
the
isotopic
composition
of
inﬁltration
water
due
to
seasonal
bias
may
have
been
retained
in
the
drip
waters
forming
the
speleothem
calcite
.
By
contrast
,
slower
drips
at
the
site
of
RC2
may
represent
a
more
homogeneous
average
of
summer
and
winter
inﬁltration
.
Evidence
of
intra
—
cave
isotopic
variability
in
Holocene
speleothems
from
Norway
is
suggested
to
result
from
differences
in
percolation
pathways
and
effects
of
surface
vegetation
and
topography
on
these
waters
(
Linge
al.
,
2001
)
.
A
long
—
term
,
detailed
investigation
of
intra
—
cave
dripwater
variability
is
needed
before
these
theories
can
be
conﬁrmed
.
Seasonal
bias
in
recharge
can
also
inﬂuence
the
value
of
y
for
a
site
,
since
climatecontrolled
changes
in
preferential
delivery
of
lowor
high
—
8
‘
8O
waters
to
a
drip
site
can
inﬂuence
the
relationship
between
818001
and
climate
.
This
could
account
for
the
apparent
difference
in
the
sign
of
y
for
RC2
and
RC20
.
Independent
evidence
for
the
existence
of
intracave
,
inter
—
site
differences
in
8180
of
drip
waters
lies
in
our
measurements
of
drips
currently
entering
the
cave
,
which
differ
between
drip
sites
by
as
much
as
5
%
o
.
It
is
conceivable
that
such
inter
—
site
differences
could
have
existed
during
the
Pleistocene
as
well
.
The
reasons
for
these
differences
in
mean
8180
of
drip
water
are
not
well
understood
,
and
presumably
relate
to
subtle
differences
in
the
routes
followed
by
recharge
water
from
the
surface
to
cave
drip
sites
.
Terrain
and
vegetation
differences
above
the
cave
could
have
led
to
diﬂer
—
ences
in
the
proportion
of
winter
vs.
summer
precipitation
entering
the
cave
.
An
alternative
explanation
is
that
modern
drip
paths
have
been
highly
disturbed
by
quarrying
activities
.
Soil
has
been
removed
from
the
quarry
surface
and
reduced
on
the
ﬂanks
in
preparation
for
extension
of
the
quarry
.
The
impact
may
have
widened
variability
in
the
isotopic
composition
of
the
drips
.
This
makes
the
direct
comparison
of
modern
and
Quaternary
dripwaters
impossible
,
but
the
drips
from
the
New
Formations
room
gave
more
depleted
values
of
-12
to
-13.5
%
o
.
This
may
be
more
representative
of
modern
values
as
the
calculated
calcite
—
water
pair
temperatures
(
9.8
i2
.4
°
C
)
were
close
to
modern
measured
average
temperature
(
8
°
C
)
.
The
smoother
record
of
RC2
over
the
interval
of
coeval
growth
with
RC20
may
indicate
that
feed
water
to
RC2
was
spending
a
long
time
in
the
recharge
zone
,
permitting
long
—
term
homogenization
of
waters
and
an
absence
of
seasonal
bias
.
Higher
variability
of
the
record
for
RC20
as
well
as
its
much
faster
growth
rate
are
consistent
with
rapid
inﬁltration
times
at
this
site
.
The
high
frequency
variation
of
8180
“
prior
to
the
gradual
increase
at
54
ooo
years
ago
is
similar
to
ﬂuctuations
seen
over
the
same
interval
in
Soreq
Cave
stalagmites
(
Fig.
7
)
.
There
is
a
negative
shift
of
3
%
»
in
813C
at
59
ooo
years
ago
that
is
synchronous
with
warming
in
the
marine
record
(
Martinson
al.
,
1987
)
and
precedes
a
similar
but
larger
shift
in
513C
at
Crevice
Cave
(
Fig.
8b
;
al.
,
1998
)
.
The
isotopic
record
for
sample
RC2
shows
frequency
of
oscillations
dissimilar
to
that
of
sample
RC20
during
their
coeval
period
of
growth
.
RC2
exhibits
higher
frequency
oscillations
after
50
ooo
years
ago
.
This
reinforces
the
idea
that
growth
rate
may
be
responsible
for
the
differences
in
the
two
records
over
their
coeval
period
of
growth
.
After
50
ooo
years
ago
,
the
measured
growth
rate
for
RC2
also
increases
by
over
an
order
of
magnitude
to
more
closely
resemble
that
of
RC20
.
In
addition
,
the
range
of
8180
“
increases
to
-8.5
to
—
12.2
%
o
,
not
unlike
the

The

inﬂuenced
by
the

of

from

The

the
longer

in

RC2
is
evidence
that
distant
speleo

thems
can
be
recording
the
same
relative
changes
in
global
temperature
.
The
diﬂiculty
of
interpreting
carbon

is
attributed
to
complex
interactions
such
as
soil
respiration
and
carbonate
dissolution
in
the
aquifer
systems
overlying
the

(
Baker

.
The

The

from

in

Conclusions
records
can
help
us
determine
if
these
are
local
and/or
proxy
speciﬁc
cycles
or
if
they
are
truly
recording
the
Dansgaard
—
Oeschger
events
.
The
power
spectra
from
the
two
speleothems
are
in
closer
agreement
than
the
oxygen
isotope
time
series
(
Fig.
9
)
.
The
RC2
record
does
not
agree
well
with
the
GISP2
record
in
the
time
domain
but
they
agree
well
in
the
frequency
domain
.
This
is
consistent
with
global
linkage
but
not
at
the
level
of
individual
events
.
The
spectra
show
similar
peaks
although
their
power
varies
.
There
is
a
7650
—
year
cycle
in
the
full
time
series
for
stalagmite
RC2
,
which
agrees
very
well
with
average
spacing
of
7980
years
for
Heinrich
events

—

using
the
median
of
several
reported
ages
compiled
by
(

.
Shorter
l500
—
year
and
l600
—
year
cycles
are
present
in
both
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothems
but
do
not
show
a
strong
power
relative
to
the
other
peaks
in
RC2
when
computed
within
its
full
time
series
.
Better
resolution
of
these
cycles
is
seen
when
the
8000

year
,
20
ooo
—
year
and
41000year
peaks
are
removed
(

)
.
Because
there
is
temporal
variability
in
the
speleothem
oxygen
isotope
record
and
in
both
growth
rate
and
climate
over
time
,
spectra
were
obtained
for
the
different
phases
of
growth
in
the
two
speleothems
.
Power
spectra
for
the
full
oxygen
isotope
time
series
for
RC2
and
RC20
have
peaks
at
the
1000
—
2000
—
year
periodicity
,
but
they
are
below
the
95
%
signiﬁcance
level
.
For
the
periods
50000
—
24000
years
ago
and
50000
—
30000
years
ago
in
speleothem
RC2
,
there
is
signiﬁcant
periodicity
at
both
8000
years
and
1600
years
(
Fig.
9
)
,
while
the
faster
growth
rate
of
RC20
allows
us
to
observe
cyclicity
with
a
period
of
about
1000
years
;
even
higher
frequency
oscillations
are
evident
in
the
813C
record
of
RC20
.
This
millennial
—
scale
cyclicity
supports
the
notion
that
there
were
periods
of
higher
instability
in
climate
during
the
last
glacial
cycle
.
Spectral
analysis
of
the
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothems
provides
additional
evidence
that
the
cave
is
responding
to
a
mechanism
that
is
affecting
climate
on
a
hemispheric
and
likely
a
global
scale

inﬂuence

record
.
The
two
partially
coeval
speleothems
from
this
cave
display
strikingly
different

records
,
showing
that
different
drip

in

differently
to

.
Differing
speleothem
morphology
may
also
exert
control
on

between
the

,
of

probably
as
a
result
of
seasonal
bias
in
the
recharge
of
drip
water
to
one
of
the

or
by

of

the
