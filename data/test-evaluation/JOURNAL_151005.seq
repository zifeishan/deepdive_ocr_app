Palaeogeographic
implications
Abstract
The
Bajocian
and
the
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
crinoidal
limestones
of
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
(
PKB
)
,
Western
Carpathians
and
the
Bathonian
–
Callovian
neptunian
dykes
which
cut
them
were
sampled
for
rock
magnetic
and
palaeomagnetic
study
.
The
sampled
sections
were
:
Babiná
,
Mestečko
,
Vršatec
,
Bolešovská
dolina
and
Szaflary
.
SIRM
(
T
)
curves
show
that
the
limestone
and
the
dykes
from
Mestečko
contain
hematite
with
blocking
temperature
T
b
about
650
–
670
°
C.
Babiná
limestone
and
dykes
contain
magnetite
with
T
b
between
470
and
570
°
C
,
usually
accompanied
by
small
hematite
tail
.
Sometimes
goethite
with
T
b
about
80
–
100
°
C
is
seen
.
Dykes
and
limestone
from
Vršatec
contain
magnetite
with
T
b
of
570
°
C
or
hematite
with
unblocking
temperature
of
670
°
C
.
After
cleaning
of
recent
soft
component
by
a
temperature
of
200
°
C
and
a
field
of
10
–
20
mT
,
the
hard
component
was
revealed
.
After
tilt
correction
the
locality-mean
directions
found
in
limestones
have
scattered
declination
but
similar
reversed
inclination
between
−
35
°
and
–
40
°
for
the
Bajocian
and
between
−
35
°
and
−
49
°
for
the
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
.
An
exception
was
the
mean
direction
for
the
Bajocian
limestone
from
Bolešovská
dolina
which
has
normal
polarity
.
Fold
test
for
inclination
only
showed
pre-folding
inclinations
for
the
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestones
and
scattered
inclinations
for
the
in
situ
and
tilt
corrected
directions
for
the
dykes
.
The
mean
palaeoinclination
calculated
for
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
by
means
of
“
inclination-only
”
test
are
−
38.5
°
+
/
−
3
°
and
−
42.5
°
+
/
−
11.2
°
,
respectively
,
which
corresponds
to
21.7
+
/
−
1.5
°
N
and
24.6
+
/
−
5.6
°
N
of
palaeolatitude
.
This
is
about
10
°
–
15
°
lower
than
the
value
of
inclination
expected
for
that
age
for
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
from
the
Jurassic
poles
for
Stable
Europe
.
As
positive
inclination
only
fold
test
proves
pre-folding
age
of
isolating
directions
other
possibility
—
flattening
of
inclination
should
be
considered
.
Anisotropy
of
magnetic
susceptibility
(
AMS
)
and
magnetic
unhysteretic
remanent
magnetisation
(
AARM
)
can
be
used
for
the
evaluation
of
origin
and
for
the
deviation
of
natural
remanent
magnetisation
NRM
.
The
axes
of
AMS
are
scattered
for
all
localities
.
The
degree
of
anisotropy
is
low
.
The
shape
parameter
T
shows
equal
distribution
of
oblate
and
prolate
fabric
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
ARM
maximum
axes
are
well
clustered
,
especially
for
Mestečko
and
Vršatec
.
The
maximum
axes
are
distributed
in
a
vertical
plane
for
Mestečko
and
in
horizontal
plane
for
Babiná
and
Vršatec
.
This
evidences
that
the
AARM
fabric
is
not
related
to
sedimentation
and
compaction
.
The
anisotropy
axes
are
not
close
to
the
NRM
directions
.
For
Mestečko
they
are
steeper
.
This
excludes
an
effect
of
shallowing
of
NRM
.
On
this
basis
we
can
assume
that
more
southern
palaeolatitude
of
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
than
expected
is
a
demonstration
of
palaeogeography
and
tectonics
and
points
to
a
close
vicinity
of
the
PKB
to
the
African
plate
in
the
Jurassic
.
The
results
from
the
Polish
part
of
PKB
which
emerged
in
the
latest
years
showed
the
same
palaeolatitude
for
the
Callovian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestones
.
The
low
palaeomagnetic
inclinations
measured
in
the
Bajocian
crinoidal
limestones
show
that
the
southward
drift
may
have
started
earlier
than
previously
expected
.

Introduction
The
Jurassic
period
was
characterised
by
a
continuous
break-up
of
Pangea
by
opening
of
the
Central
Atlantic
.
The
process
continued
to
the
margin
of
the
North
European
Platform
where
it
caused
breakage
of
the
shelf
area
(
Mandl
,
2000
)
.
After
the
shelf
was
separated
from
the
main
land
,
a
system
of
oceans
,
called
the
Penninic
Ocean
(
Ligurian
–
Piemontaise
–
Penninic
–
Vahic
)
formed
between
them
.
This
break-up
was
characterised
by
passive
rifting
with
asymmetric
extension
(
Kováč
et
al.
,
1993
)
,
causing
dissection
of
the
previously
flat
shelf
and
leaving
numerous
segments
of
continental
crust
within
the
ocean
.
One
of
these
segments
was
the
Oravic
segment
which
recently
forms
the
substantial
part
of
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
in
the
Carpathian
arc
.
This
belt
represents
the
boundary
between
the
Carpathian
internides
and
externides
in
the
Western
and
Eastern
Carpathians
.
The
zone
itself
is
a
narrow
strip
of
non-volcanic
mélange
consisting
mostly
of
Jurassic
to
Cretaceous
sedimentary
rocks
.
Despite
strong
deformation
,
thermal
overprint
on
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
rocks
was
relatively
low
and
palaeomagnetic
methods
were
successfully
used
in
palaeogeographic
reconstructions
(
e.g.
Pagáč
and
Marschalko
,
1979
,
Aubrecht
and
Túnyi
,
2001
,
Grabowski
et
al.
,
2008
,
Grabowski
,
1997
,
Grabowski
and
Michalík
,
2005
,
Krs
et
al.
,
1996
,
Kruczyk
et
al.
,
1992
and
Pruner
et
al.
,
1998
)
and
magnetostratigraphy
(
Houša
et
al.
,
1999
and
Lewandowski
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
The
palaeomagnetic
analyses
showed
surprisingly
low
palaeomagnetic
inclinations
for
the
time
interval
near
the
Middle/Late
Jurassic
boundary
.
These
low
inclinations
correspond
with
low
geographic
latitudes
in
the
time
when
the
measured
sediments
originated
.
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
not
only
showed
that
the
Penninic
ocean
might
be
considerably
wider
than
supposed
by
the
earlier
workers
who
attempted
to
reconstruct
this
domain
(
e.g.
Stampfli
and
Borel
,
2002
)
but
their
results
from
the
Velyky
Kamenets
locality
of
the
Czorsztyn
Unit
(
a
shallow-water
unit
originally
belonging
to
the
Oravic
crustal
segment
)
indicated
that
Penninic
spreading
should
be
unusually
rapid
(
about
1000
km
per
6
Ma
)
.
The
basis
of
their
assumption
was
a
big
difference
between
the
palaeomagnetic
inclinations
in
the
Bajocian
–
Bathonian
limestones
and
the
overlying
Oxfordian
limestones
.
This
change
in
inclination
happened
mostly
during
the
Callovian
which
,
however
,
represents
just
a
stratigraphic
gap
at
the
studied
locality
(
omission
surface
)
.
The
lower
palaeogeographic
latitudes
of
the
Oravic
units
in
the
Late
Jurassic
were
also
confirmed
by
other
data
(
e.g.
Houša
et
al.
,
1999
,
Aubrecht
and
Túnyi
,
2001
,
Lewandowski
et
al.
,
2006
and
Grabowski
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
Very
few
data
exist
from
the
Bajocian
–
Bathonian
time
interval
.
Therefore
,
there
was
little
evidence
for
the
estimation
of
a
spreading
speed
.
This
paper
brings
further
data
,
including
also
measurements
from
the
Bajocian
limestones
.

.
Geological
setting
and
the
sections
studied
For
this
study
,
the
localities
of
Aubrecht
and
Túnyi
(
2001
)
and
one
additional
locality
were
sampled
and
analysed
(
Fig.
1
)
.
The
studied
sections
belong
to
the
Czorsztyn
Succession
which
was
palaeogeographically
situated
in
the
most
shallow
part
of
the
Oravic
sedimentary
area
,
close
to
the
so-called
Czorsztyn
Swell
(
Birkenmajer
,
1977
)
.
Sedimentary
evolution
of
this
unit
to
a
large
extent
reflects
the
Middle
Jurassic
extension
.
After
the
Aalenian
time
of
relatively
uniform
sedimentation
of
dysoxic
to
suboxic
facies
of
black
shales
and
spotted
marls
,
shallowing
started
in
the
Bajocian
,
evidenced
by
the
deposition
of
crinoidal
limestones
,
which
in
the
western
segment
of
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
were
preceded
by
the
coral
reef
limestones
(
Vršatec
Limestone
—
Schlögl
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
The
crinoidal
limestones
are
traditionally
divided
to
the
lower
,
white
Smolegowa
Limestone
Formation
and
the
upper
,
red
Krupianka
Limestone
Formation
(
Birkenmajer
,
1977
)
.
This
division
has
,
however
,
limited
validity
as
at
most
occurrences
in
the
western
part
of
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
,
colour-based
stratigraphic
division
is
not
possible
(
Aubrecht
,
1992
and
Aubrecht
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
The
originally
estimated
age
of
the
crinoidal
limestones
was
also
changed
by
later
research
;
from
Bajocian
–
Bathonian
,
as
inferred
by
Birkenmajer
(
1977
)
it
was
restricted
solely
to
Bajocian
(
Krobicki
and
Wierzbowski
,
2004
)
.
The
global
sea-level
rise
after
Bajocian
caused
submersion
of
the
Czorsztyn
Swell
and
deepening
of
the
neighbouring
sedimentary
areas
.
This
is
reflected
in
the
Czorsztyn
Succession
by
the
onset
of
typical
Rosso
Ammonitico
limestones
in
the
uppermost
Bajocian
(
Parkinsoni
Zone
—
Rakús
,
1990
,
Wierzbowski
et
al.
,
1999
and
Schlögl
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
Originally
this
onset
was
estimated
to
start
in
Callovian
(
Birkenmajer
,
1977
)
.
At
some
localities
,
the
limestones
lack
nodularity
and
are
named
as
the
Bohunice
Limestone
Formation
(
Mišík
et
al.
,
1994
)
.
This
pelagic
sedimentation
lasted
to
Early
Cretaceous
.
Pelagic
sedimentary
material
also
fills
neptunian
dykes
which
were
the
subject
of
previous
palaeomagnetic
study
of
Aubrecht
and
Túnyi
(
2001
)
.
In
the
present
study
,
the
same
sections
were
studied
in
the

in

.
At
all
localities
,
the
Bajocian
crinoidal
limestones
and
the
red
,
micritic
Bohunice
Limestones
were
sampled
,
the
latter
also
from
neptunian
dykes
.
A
total
of
62
hand
samples
were
taken
.
3
.
Methods
Three
or
more
cylindrical
specimens
of
2
×
2.2
cm
size
were
cut
from
each
hand
sample
.
Samples
were
measured
in
the
Paleomagnetic
Laboratory
in
the
Institute
of
Geophysics
,
Slovak
Academy
of
Sciences
in
Bratislava
and
in
the
Paleomagnetic
Laboratory
of
the
Institute
of
Geophysics
,
Polish
Academy
of
Sciences
in
Warsaw
.
In
the
Warsaw
laboratory
remanent
magnetisation
was
measured
by
a
2G
SQUID
cryogenic
magnetometer
accompanied
by
an
AF
demagnetiser
.
Thermal
demagnetisation
(
TD
)
was
performed
in
a
screened
furnace
made
by
the
Magnetic
Measurements
,
UK
.
Palaeomagnetic
measurements
were
carried
out
in
the
magnetically
shielded
room
.
Samples
were
demagnetised
by
thermal
(
TD
)
and
alternating
field
(
AF
)
treatment
.
In
Bratislava
mainly
TD
was
performed
using
a
demagnetising
system
MAVACS
made
in
Czech
Republic
.
Remanent
magnetisation
was
measured
by
a
spinner
magnetometer
JR-5
made
by
the
AGICO
,
Czech
Republic
.
Demagnetisation
curves
were
analysed
using
the
principal
component
analysis
of
Kirschvink
(
1980
)
by
means
of
the
PDA
programme
package
(
Lewandowski
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
Magnetic
mineralogy
was
determined
by
continuous
TD
of
saturation
isothermal
remanence
(
SIRM
)
.
Continuous
thermal
demagnetisation
of
SIRM
was
carried
out
with
the
use
of
a
device
made
by
the
TUS
,
Poland
.
SIRM
was
imparted
on
a
sample
in
the
field
of
9
T
and
measured
during
heating
to
700
°
C
in
a
magnetic
screen
.
The
SIRM
decay
curves
provide
blocking
temperature
(
T
b
)
spectra
of
magnetic
minerals
.
A
KLY-2
Kappa-bridge
was
used
for
measurements
of
anisotropy
of
magnetic
susceptibility
(
AMS
)
and
mean
susceptibility
.
Anisotropy
parameters
were
calculated
using
the
programme
ANISO
of
Jelínek
(
1977
)
.

Results
Fig.

shows
the
examples
of
SIRM
(
T
)
curves
for
limestone
and
dykes
from
Mestečko
,
Babiná
and
Vršatec
.
The
limestone
and
neptunian
dykes
from
Mestečko
contain
haematite
with
blocking
temperature
of
about
650
–
670
°
C
(
Fig.
2
a
,
b
)
.
The
Babiná
limestone
and
dykes
contain
magnetite
with
T
b
between
470
and
570
°
C
,
usually
accompanied
by
small
hematite
tail
(
Fig.
2
c
,
d
)
.
Sometimes
goethite
with
T
b
of
about
80
–
100
°
C
is
seen
(
Fig.
2
b
,
c
)
.
The
dykes
and
limestone
from
Vršatec
contain
magnetite
with
T
b
of
570
°
C
(
Fig.
2
e
)
or
hematite
with
unblocking
temperature
of
670
°
C
(
Fig.
2
f
)
.
Both
magnetic
minerals
magnetite
and
hematite
can
be
carriers
of
primary
or
secondary
magnetisation
.
Majority
of
the
samples
were
demagnetised
smoothly
and
were
suitable
for
isolating
of
palaeomagnetic
components
.
Fig.
3
shows
the
examples
of
thermal
and
AF
demagnetisation
treatments
.
A
soft
component
was
usually
removed
by
a
temperature
of
200
°
C
and
a
field
of
10
–
20
mT.
A
hard
component
was
removed
at
a
different
temperature
range
and
a
different
field
intensity
depending
on
locality
.
For
the
samples
of
limestone
and
dykes
from
Mestečko
,
the
hard
component
of
NRM
was
removed
by
a
temperature
of
500
–
650
°
C.
AF
field
of
100
mT
usually
was
not
sufficient
for
erasing
NRM
to
zero
.
About
40
–
50
%
of
remanence
remained
stable
up
to
the
field
of
100
mT
(
Fig.
3
b
)
.
High
stability
for
AF
demagnetisation
and
high
unblocking
temperature
pointed
to
hematite
and
confirmed
interpretation
of
the
SIRM
(
T
)
decay
curves
.
The
rocks
from
Babiná
and
Bolešovská
dolina
were
less
stable
.
They
were
demagnetised
by
a
field
of
40
mT
and
a
temperature
of
400
–
500
°
C.
However
,
some
samples
were
very
stable
and
about
10
–
15
%
of
the
initial
intensity
of
NRM
were
not
demagnetised
by
the
field
of
100
mT
(
Fig.

)
.
The
samples
from
Vršatec
were
usually
demagnetised
at
the
temperature
of
450
–
550
°
C
and
by
a
field
of
100
mT.
After
removal
of
a
spurious
,
recent
remagnetisation
,
the
in
situ
mean
directions
for
the
Bajocian
limestone
for
particular
localities
(
Klippen
)
formed
group
of
normal
polarity
with
steep
inclinations
and
NE
declinations
with
the
exception
of
direction
for
the
Babiná
limestone
which
show
shallow
reversed
inclination
and
EES
declination
(
Fig.

,
Table

)
.
A
group
of
the
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestones
comprises
two
directions
of
normal
polarity
with
steep
inclination
for
Mestečko
and
Vršatec
,
and
one
direction
of
reversed
shallow
inclination
for
Babiná
(
Fig.
4
A
)
.
After
tilt
correction
the
locality-mean
directions
have
scattered
declination
but
similar
reversed
inclination
between
−
35
°
and
−
40
°
for
Bajocian
and
between
−
35
°
and
−
49
°
for
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
rocks
.
An
exception
was
the
mean
direction
for
the
Bajocian
limestone
from
Bolešovská
Dolina
which
has
a
normal
polarity
(
Fig.

)
.
The
mean
palaeoinclinations

means
of
“

only
”
test
(
Enkin
,
1994
and
Enkin
and
Watson
,
1996
)
for
the
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
are
−
38.5
°
and
−
42.5
°
,
respectively
,
which
correspond
to
21.7
°
N
and
24.6
°
N
of
a
palaeolatitude
with
the
assumption
of
reversed
polarity
(
Table

)
.
The
mean

for
the
Bathonian
–
Callovian
dykes
are
scattered
both
,
in

and
after

Timing
of
the
hard
component
The
age
of
hard
component
can
be
inferred
from
its
inclination
.
Fold
test
for
inclination
only
(
Enkin
,
1994
and
Enkin
and
Watson
,
1996
)
made
for
the
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestones
(
Fig.
5
)
showed
the
pre-folding
inclination
.
The
calculation
from
inclination
palaeolatitudes
are
closely
grouped
for
the
limestones
(
Fig.
6
)
but
scattered
for
the
dykes
.
It
means
that
the
rocks
under
study
did
not
undergo
overall
remagnetisation
.
Magnetisation
of
the
limestones
can
be
related
to
early
diagenesis
processes
whereas
in
the
dykes
influence
of
the
process
of
mechanical
filling
resulted
in
scattered
magnetisation
.
The
mean
palaeoinclinations
obtained
for
the
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestones
(
−
38.5
°
and
−
42.5
°
,
respectively
)
,
and
corresponding
palaeolatitudes
(
21.7
°
N
and
24.6
°
N
)
are
about
10
°
–
15
°
lower
than
the
value
of
inclination
expected
for
that
age
for
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
from
the
Jurassic
poles
for
Stable
Europe
(
Besse
and
Courtillot
,
2002
)
.
As
the
positive
fold
test
proves
the
pre-folding
age
of
isolating
directions
the
difference
might
be
due
to
either
erroneous
evaluation
of
palaeomagnetic
inclination
or
to
palaeogeography
.
The
first
possibility
could
be
the
effect
of
flattening
of
inclination
.
Palaeomagnetic
inclinations
in
sedimentary
rocks
are
frequently
reported
to
be
too
shallow
(
Jackson
et
al.
,
1991
,
Tan
et
al.
,
2007
and
Tauxe
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
The
problem
is
especially
significant
in
hematite-bearing
sediments
.
Recognition
and
correction
of
inclination
flattening
is
therefore
critical
before
any
palaeogeographic
reconstruction
could
be
made
.
For
this
aim
anisotropy
of
magnetic
susceptibility
and
remanence
has
been
studied
.
4.2
.
Anisotropy
of
magnetic
susceptibility
and
remanence
Anisotropy
of
magnetic
susceptibility
(
AMS
)
can
be
used
for
evaluation
of
origin
and
deviation
of
NRM
in
sedimentary
rocks
.
The
typical
sedimentary
fabric
is
characterised
by
dominance
of
foliation
which
is
near-parallel
to
the
bedding
plane
;
intermediate
and
maximum
directions
are
scattered
in
the
foliation
plane
.
In
this
type
of
fabric
,
we
can
expect
inclination
shallowing
due
to
compaction
,
if
we
deal
with
a
detrital
remanence
.
Ordering
in
the
foliation
plane
,
when
observed
,
is
attributed
to
orientation
either
by
current
or
by
weak
deformation
.
In
the
first
case
(
para
)
magnetic
grains
are
also
likely
to
be
aligned
with
the
current
and
there
is
a
possibility
that
palaeomagnetic
declination
deviates
from
palaeo-north
towards
the
current
direction
.
Anisotropy
of
remanence
is
determined
by
the
distribution
and
orientation
of
ferromagnetic
particles
and
by
their
anisotropies
.
As
ferromagnetic
particles
are
the
carriers
of
palaeomagnetic
directions
,
the
fabric
of
the
ferromagnetic
grains
and
their
eventual
alignment
is
relevant
to
the
bias
problem
.
Inclination
shallowing
has
been
recognised
and
corrected
by
means
of
anisotropy
of
remanent
magnetisation
(
Jackson
et
al.
,
1991
and
Tan
et
al.
,
2003
)
.
Anisotropy
of
remanence
may
be
measured
by
imposing
on
a
specimen
a
certain
type
of
magnetic
remanence
.
The
most
useful
remanence
is
an
isothermal
(
IRM
)
or
an
anhysteretic
(
ARM
)
remanence
.
Several
methods
are
applied
for
determining
a
remanence
tensor
.
They
involve
magnetising
a
sample
repeatedly
in
different
directions
and
measuring
a
remanence
acquired
parallel
to
the
applied
field
or
measuring
all
three
components
of
remanence
.
At
least
six
independent
components
must
be
measured
.
The
ARM
was
acquired
at
100
mT
of
AF
field
and
100
μT
of
DC
field
using
an
AMU-1
/
LDA-1
device
made
by
AGICO
,
Czech
Republic
.
The
ARM
was
measured
by
a
JR4
spinner
magnetometer
.
In
our
experiment
the
anhysteretic
remanence
(
ARM
)
was
imposed
on
a
sample
in
six
directions
along
face-diagonals
.
The
6-direction
scheme
along
face-diagonals
was
selected
as
a
fast
robust
method
of
the
ARM
tensor
determination
with
a
sufficient
accuracy
.
This
scheme
was
employed
by
AGICO
for
the
AREF
software
which
we
used
for
the
ARM
tensor
calculation
(
Jelínek
,
1993
–
1996
)
.
Maximum
and
minimum
axes
of
AMS
and
ARM
together
with
anisotropy
parameters
:
T-shape
parameter
and
P
j
-
degree
of
anisotropy
were
plotted
on
a
stereonet
for
each
locality
in
the
geographic
co-ordinate
system
(
Fig.
7
)
.
The
axes
of
anisotropy
of
magnetic
susceptibility
are
scattered
for
all
localities
.
There
is
no
foliation
or
lineation
determined
.
The
degree
of
anisotropy
is
low
.
The
shape
parameter
T
shows
equal
distribution
of
oblate
and
prolate
fabric
.
This
gives
evidence
that
the
AMS
fabric
is
not
related
to
sedimentation
and
compaction
processes
,
and
that
the
detrital
component
is
negligible
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
ARM
maximum
axes
are
well
clustered
,
especially
for
Mestečko
and
Vršatec
.
The
minimum
axes
are
distributed
in
a
horizontal
plane
(
Fig.
7
A
,
C
)
.
For
the
Babiná
limestones
,
the
ARM
maximum
axes
are
not
as
well
clustered
as
for
Mestečko
and
Vršatec
.
The
ARM
minimum
axes
are
randomly
distributed
.
For
Mestečko
and
Vršatec
,
the
magnetic
fabric
changed
to
prolate
as
the
T
parameter
is
negative
.
For
Babiná
(
Fig.
7
B
)
T
changed
towards
positive
values
.
The
mean
maximum
axes
of
AARM
were
calculated
for
the
Bajocian
and
the
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestones
and
the
dykes
for
Mestečko
,
for
the
Vršatec
dykes
,
and
for
the
Babiná
Bajocian
limestones
(
Table
2
)
.
For
other
units
the
calculation
was
not
possible
because
AARM
was
measured
for
a
not
sufficient
number
of
samples
.
Fig.
8
shows
the
distribution
of
locality
means
of
the
ARM
maximum
axes
in
situ
and
after
tilt
correction
.
The
in
situ
directions
are
steep
and
well
grouped
.
After
bedding
correction
the
AARM
maximum
axes
for
Mestečko
remained
steep
but
for
Vršatec
and
Babiná
the
maximum
axes
shifted
to
a
horizontal
position
.
It
is
possible
that
AARM
reflects
difference
in
magnetic
carriers
—
hematite
for
Mestečko
,
magnetite
for
Babiná
and
mixture
for
Vršatec
.
A
lack
of
sedimentary
fabric
expressed
by
negligible
AMS
anisotropy
and
steep
foliation
planes
for
AARM
,
points
out
to
the
exact
representation
of
a
palaeofield
by
the
NRM
inclination
.
Different
magnetic
carriers
,
magnetite
and
hematite
,
and
the
steeper
ARM
maximum
axes
than
the
NRM
directions
also
evidence
that
the
inclination
of
NRM
directions
was
not
shallowed
.

.
Discussion
The
positive
inclination
only
fold
test
and
the
magnetic
anisotropy
study
evidence
that
the
NRM
directions
isolated
in
the
studied
rocks
represent
pre-folding
and
probably
primary
inclinations
.
Consistent
inclinations
and
scattered
declinations
evidence
horizontal
rotations
of
particular
blocks
inside
the
PKB
which
is
typical
for
a
mélange
zone
.
The
mean
palaeoinclinations
calculated
for
the
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestone
are
−
38.5
°
and
−
42.5
°
,
respectively
,
which
corresponds
to
21.7
°
N
and
24.6
°
N
of
palaeolatitude
(
Table
1
)
.
Krs
et
al.
,
1996
,
Kruczyk
et
al.
,
1992
and
Grabowski
,
1997
reported
low
palaeolatitudes
(
26.9
°
,
25.8
°
,
27.4
°
,
and
29
°
N
,
respectively
)
for
carbonates
from
North
Slovakia
.
They
explained
such
palaeolatitudes
by
clockwise
rotation
.
When
compared
the
position
of
the
PKB
in
Bajocian
–
Kimmeridgian
expressed
by
a
palaeolatitude
based
on
Grabowski
et
al.
(
2008
)
and
on
our
study
with
the
position
of
Europe
and
Africa
calculated
from
the
APWP
(
Besse
and
Courtillot
,
2002
and
Muttoni
et
al.
,
2001
)
it
is
seen
(
Fig.
9
)
that
the
PKB
was
placed
in
that
time
in
the
vicinity
of
Africa
.
According
to
the
palaeolatitude
values
,
in
Oxfordian
the
PKB
was
farther
to
the
north
than
in
Bajocian
which
can
point
out
that
at
this
time
the
PKB
began
drifting
to
the
north
.
The
new
data
presented
in
this
paper
roughly
correspond
with
those
presented
by
Aubrecht
and
Túnyi
(
2001
)
and
are
in
accordance
with
the
data
obtained
by
Grabowski
et
al.
(
2008
)
from
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
,
see
the
Introduction
chapter
.
However
,
the
data
from
the
Bajocian
crinoidal
limestones
differ
from
those
presented
by
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
as
the
inclinations
(
and
the
calculated
palaeolatitudes
as
well
)
are
different
.
The
pre-Callovian
data
of
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
showed
palaeolatitudes
that
were
in
accordance
with
the
coeval
approximate
latitude
of
the
North-European
platform
from
which
the
Oravic
segment
was
separated
.
In
further
publications
(
Lewandowski
et
al.
,
2006
and
Grabowski
et
al.
,
2008
)
,
only
younger
(
Oxfordian
)
data
are
presented
.
Our
data
confirm
results
pointing
to
the
Late
Jurassic
low-latitude
position
of
the
Oravic
segment
but
also
show
that
this
segment
might
reach
this
position
earlier
(
in
Bajocian
)
.
That
means
they
do
not
contest
the
final
width
of
the
new
,
Jurassic
(
Penninic
)
ocean
but
they
question
its
spreading
rate
.
The
spreading
rate
proposed
by
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
was
unusually
high
and
uneasy
to
explain
.
There
is
a
vast
number
of
literature
dealing
with
petrography
of
the
Penninic
rocks
and
their
tectonic
history
but
very
few
works
dealt
with
the
problems
of
a
width
of
this
oceanic
realm
.
From
the
earlier
palaeogeographic
reconstructions
,
like
those
of
Rakús
et
al.
,
1988
,
Dercourt
et
al.
,
1990
,
Michalík
,
1994
,
Rakús
,
1993
,
Vašíček
et
al.
,
1994
,
Channell
and
Kozur
,
1997
,
Stampfli
et
al.
,
1998
,
Plašienka
,
1999
,
Golonka
et
al.
,
2000
,
Stampfli
and
Borel
,
2002
and
Csontos
and
Vörös
,
2004
it
is
obvious
that
all
the
workers
considered
the
width
of
the
Penninic
Ocean
in
the
Jurassic
to
be
maximum
several
hundred
kilometres
.
Only
the
publications
from
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
and
namely
that
of
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
challenged
this
view
and
showed
that
at
least
the
Oravic
segment
had
to
be
much
more
southwards
in
the
Late
Jurassic
than
previously
thought
.
However
,
it
is
highly
improbable
that
an
isolated
crustal
segment
could
be
drifted
in
such
a
distance
alone
.
The
newly
formed
Jurassic
ocean
was
full
of
such
segments
that
were
separated
from
the
North
European
Platform
and
some
of
them
were
situated
south
of
the
Oravic
segment
.
To
enable
such
far-away
drift
without
any
collision
,
all
the
segments
should
be
drifted
more
or
less
together
in
the
same
direction
.
The
Late
Jurassic
is
the
time
of
closure
of
the
earlier
,
Triassic
branches
of
Tethys
(
see
e.g.
Channell
and
Kozur
,
1997
,
Mock
et
al.
,
1998
and
Gawlick
et
al.
,
1999
)
,
which
meant
the
final
collision
of
the
North
European
Platform-derived
blocks
with
the
South
Alpine
(
Apulian
)
segments
.
So
far
,
no
reconstructions
were
done
,
estimating
the
distance
which
these
“
North
”
blocks
had
to
overcome
.
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
showed
that
it
might
be
up
to
1000
km
.
Whether
this
is
valid
also
for
other
segments
,
like
Australpine
,
Tatric
–
Veporic
,
etc.
is
questionable
.
The
work
of
Muttoni
et
al.
(
2005
)
showed
that
palaeomagnetic
and
palaeoenvironmental
results
from
Adria
(
a
part
of
African
plate
)
suggested
a
rapid
southward
movement
of
about
15
°
succeeded
by
northward
trend
of
Adria
from
the
Early
Jurassic
to
Earliest
Cretaceous
.
The
authors
explained
this
by
underestimating
the
southward
movement
of
the
African
plate
in
that
time
due
to
smoothing
procedure
of
APW
.
It
can
cause
an
overlook
of
its
low
latitude
position
of
short
duration
.
Steinberger
and
Torsvik
(
2008
)
presented
a
model
of
TPW
based
on
a
palaeomagnetic
reference
frame
which
proposed
global
average
of
continental
motion
.
They
found
≈
18
°
clockwise
rotation
of
all
plates
between
195
and
145
Ma
of
age
.
Low
latitudes
in
the
Middle
Jurassic
–
Early
Cretaceous
times
found
for
Crimea
(
Ukraine
)
and
Pontides
(
Turkey
)
by
Meijers
et
al.
(
2010
)
confirmed
that
low
palaeolatitudes
are
also
observed
in
Eurasia
.
The
palaeomagnetic
results
from
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
appear
to
be
in
accordance
with
these
results
and
allow
to
regard
the
possibility
of
TPW
as
the
most
likely
mechanism
to
explain
the
low
palaeolatitude
of
Adria
PKB
and
,
Crimea
and
Pontides

The
mean
palaeoinclination
calculated
for
the
Bajocian
and
Oxfordian
–
Kimmeridgian
limestone
are
−
38.5
°
and
−
42.5
°
,
respectively
,
which
corresponds
to
21.7
°
N
and
24.6
°
N
of
palaeolatitude
.
This
is
about
10
°
–
15
°
lower
than
the
value
of
inclination
expected
for
that
age
for
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
from
the
Jurassic
poles
for
Stable
Europe
(
Besse
and
Courtillot
,
2002
,
Krs
et
al.
,
1996
and
Pruner
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
On
this
basis
we
can
assume
that
more
southern
palaeolatitude
of
the
Pieniny
Klippen
Belt
than
expected
is
a
demonstration
of
palaeogeography
and
tectonics
and
points
to
close
vicinity
of
the
PKB
to
the
African
plate
in
Jurassic
.
The
lower
palaeolatitudes
estimated
for
the
Bajocian
limestones
show
that
the
southward
drift
of
the
Oravic
crustal
segment
started
earlier
than
inferred
by
Lewandowski
et
al.
(
2004
)
.
The
other
possibility
of
TPW
of
Eurasia
and
Africa
continent
should
be
also
taken
into
consideration
