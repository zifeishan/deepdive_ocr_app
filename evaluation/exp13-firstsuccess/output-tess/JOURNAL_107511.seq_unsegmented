Abstract
A
wide
range
of
selective
pressures
have
been
advanced
as
possible
causes
for
the
adoption
of
bipedalism
in
the
hominin
lineage
.
One
suggestion
has
been
that
because
modern
human
walking
is
relatively
eﬂicient
compared
to
that
of
a
typical
quadruped
,
the
ancestral
quadruped
may
have
reaped
an
energetic
advantage
when
it
walked
on
two
legs
.
While
it
has
become
clear
that
human
walking
is
relatively
efficient
and
human
running
inefﬁcient
compared
to
“
generalized
endotherms
”
,
workers
differ
in
their
opinion
of
how
the
cost
of
human
bipedal
locomotion
compares
to
that
of
a
generalized
primate
walking
quadrupedally
.
One
View
is
that
human
walking
is
particularly
efficient
in
comparison
to
other
primates
.
The
present
study
addresses
this
by
comparing
the
cost
of
human
walking
and
running
to
that
of
the
eight
primate
species
for
which
data
are
available
and
by
comparing
cost
in
primates
to
that
of
a
“
generalized
endotherm
”
.
There
is
no
evidence
that
primate
locomotion
is
more
costly
than
that
of
a
generalized
endotherm
,
although
more
data
on
adult
Old
World
monkeys
and
apes
would
be
useful
.
Further
,
human
locomotion
does
not
appear
to
be
particularly
eﬂicient
relative
to
that
of
other
primates
.

The
present
study
contributes
to
the
discussion
of
whether
selection
for
energetic
efﬁciency
was
an
important
factor
in
the
origin
of
bipedality
.
It
has
become
clear
that
human
walking
is
inexpensive
and
human
running
is
usually
expensive
compared
to
that
of
a
typical
quadruped
(
Steudel
,
1994
,
1996
)
.
There
is
,
however
,
no
consensus
on
the
efficiency
of
human
locomotion
compared
to
that
of
other
primates
.
Rodman
and
McHenry
(
1980
)
compared
the
cost
of
human
walking
to
that
of
chimpanzees
and
concluded
that
human
walking
is
considerably
cheaper
.
Jablonski
and
Chaplin
(
1993
)
,
on
the
other
hand
,
looked
at
the
cost
of
human
locomotion
compared
to
that
of
the
patas
monkey
and
concluded
that
“
no
special
advantage
can
be
identiﬁed
for
human
bipedalism
over
primate
quadrupedalism
.
”
Leonard
and
Robertson
(
1997
,
2001
)
have
argued
that
human
bipedalism
is
efﬁcient
relative
to
the
quadrupedal
—
ism
of
primates
generally
based
on
the
primate
cost
equation
developed
by
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
.
The
present
study
addresses
the
energetics
of
human
locomotion
based
on
a
variety
of
studies
and
puts
it
in
the
context
of
a
broad
sample
of
primates
and
of
birds
and
mammals
to
attempt
to
clarify
this
discussion
.
The
cost
of
locomotion
in
primates
is
also
compared
to
that
of
“
generalized
endotherms
”
.
The
data
The
data
on
which
these
discussions
are
based
are
measurements
of
the
energetic
cost
of
locomotion
in
a
variety
of
mammals
.
Because
ongoing
submaximal
locomotion
is
usually
powered
almost
entirely
by
ATP
generated
by
aerobic
pathways
,
experimenters
measure
the
rate
of
oxygen
consumed
by
a
subject
under
a
variety
of
locomotor
conditions
,
usually
on
a
treadmill
.
Often
the
cost
of
a
given
locomotor
activity
is
simply
reported
in
milliliters
of
oxygen
,
or
converted
to
Joules
or
kilocalories
.
The
cost
of
an
activity
can
be
expressed
as
a
rate
,
called
the
“
cost
of
locomotion
”
—
the
cost
to
engage
in
the
activity
for
a
particular
amount
of
time
.
Other
authors
focus
instead
on
the
cost
to
travel
a
particular
distance
called
the
“
cost
of
transport
”
.
It
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
amount
of
energy
that
an
animal
consumes
in
traveling
is
highly
dependent
on
its
mass
(
e.g.
Taylor
et
al.
,
1982
)
.
While
larger
animals
expend
a
greater
total
number
of
calories
because
they
are
doing
more
work
(
moving
a
greater
mass
)
,
the
cost
per
kilogram
of
body
mass
is
typically
smaller
in
a
larger
animal
and
this
reduction
has
been
well
documented
(
e.g.
Taylor
et
al.
,
1982
)
.
Because
body
mass
is
rarely
a
constant
in
most
interesting
comparisons
of
locomotor
energetics
,
nearly
all
studies
involving
comparisons
of
locomotor
costs
have
reported
the
cost
per
kilogram
.
The
baseline
expectation
for
the
cost
of
locomotion
or
cost
of
transport
are
based
on
data
on
62
mammalian
and
avian
species
,
including
eight
primate
species
,
summarized
by
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
.
The
equations
describing
the
relationship
between
cost
and
speed
for
each
species
are
presented
in
their
Table
1
.
They
also
developed
a
general
equation
(
their
Eq
.
(

)
)
summarizing
the
relationship
of
energetic
cost
of
locomotion
in
relation
to
speed
and
body
mass
across
their
entire
sample
that
I
use
here
.
I
will
refer
to
predictions
from
this
equation
as
being
for
the
generalized
endotherm
.
The
available
primate
data
are
from
a
variety
of
sources
(
Taylor
and
Rowntree
,
1973
;
Parsons
and
Taylor
,
1977
;
Mahoney
,
1980
;
Taylor
et
al.
,
1982
)
.
Values
for
human
locomotion
were
obtained
from
a
variety
of
studies
and
graphed
individually
to
allow
an
evaluation
of
consistency
.
Only
estimates
of
cost
from
studies
whose
designs
produced
steady
—
state
values
at
a
variety
of
speeds
and
where
subject
mass
was
taken
into
account
were
chosen
.
Publications
combining
results
from
a
variety
of
previously
published
works
were
excluded
.
I
included

older

the

and
to

2.5

for

species

,
for

These
speeds
were
chosen
as
appropriate
walking

running
speeds
for
the

species
included

For
humans

and

the
sources
listed

are
also
shown
.
Most
primate
species
fall

line
based

Values
for
some
primate
species
fall

;
values
for
human
walking
fall
below
.
The
cost
of

m
s
’
1
in
primates
does
not
appear
to
differ
markedly
from
the
equation
based
on
the
generalized
model
.
While
some
primate
species
show
deviations
from
the
general
line
,
so
do
individual
species
of
birds
and
mammals
(
Steudel
—
Numbers
,
2001
)
.
At
this
(
walking
)
speed
,
the
values
for
two
of
the
three
Old
World
monkeys
(
Macaca
and
Papio
)
and
for
Pan
,
all
show
positive
deviations
from
the
general
line
.
Should
we
conclude
that
Old
World
monkeys
and
apes
as
a
group
have
higher
than
expected
costs
?
Given
the
small
sample
size
,
such
a
conclusion
is
far
from
compelling
.
Further
,
the
masses
reported
for
the
Old
World
monkeys
and
Pan
indicate
that
the
test
animals
were
below
usual
adult
size
,
suggesting
that
they
may
have
been
juveniles
(
see
below
)
.
Data
on
the
species
for
which
we
have
the
most
information
(
Homo
sapiens
)
show
that
juveniles
of
that
species
exhibit
less
efﬁcient
patterns
of
locomotion
than
do
adults
(
Sutherland
et
al.
,
1980
;
Waters
et
al.
,
1988
)
.
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
(
2002
)
report
a
similar
result
in
macaques
.
If
this
pattern
is
general
,
this
may
account
for
some
positive
deviation
,
though
the
extent
of
this
will
be
dependent
on
how
immature
the
animal
was
.
In
an
attempt
to
evaluate
whether
locomotor
costs
had
been
measured
on
adult
or
immature
specimens
,
I
have
compared
the
masses
of
the
primates
on
which
costs
were
measured
to
size
estimates
for
their
species
available
in
the
literature
.
Table
1
summarizes
these
results
.
All
of
the
Old
World
monkeys
on
which
locomotor
costs
were
measured
were
substantially
smaller
than
the
smallest
documented
adult
females
in
Delson
et
al.
(
2000
)
,
suggesting
that
they
must
have
been
juveniles
.
Similarly
,
the
specimens
representing
Pan
troglodytes
were
approximately
half
the
size
of
the
average
adult
female
in
the
smallest
subspecies
reported
by
Smith
and
Jungers
(
1997
)
.
The
probable
juvenile
status
of
these
specimens
was
also
remarked

that
they
were
,
in
fact
,
adult
.
Parsons
and
Taylor
(
1977
)
report
that
the
specimens
were
acquired
as
adults
,
both
female
,
and
that
they
spent
more
than
2
years
training
them
,
leaving
little
possibility
of
doubt
.
The
two
specimens
of
Nycticebus
coucang
provide
an
interesting
comparison
.
Parsons
and
Taylor
(
1977
)
do
not
discuss
the
ages
of
their
specimens
,
but
state
that
the
larger
specimen
was
female
,
the
smaller
male
.
The
larger
specimen
was
substantially
above
average
body
mass
,
suggesting
that
she
must
have
been
adult
.
The
smaller
specimen
(
male
)
was
somewhat
below
average
adult
mass
,
suggesting
that
he
was
less
mature
than
the
larger
female
specimen
,
providing
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
the
hypothesis
that
younger
specimens
give
higher
values
.
Interestingly
,
the
value
for
the
smaller
,
presumably
(
though
not
certainly
)
younger
,
male
has
an
elevated
cost
value
,
while
the
female
’s
cost
is
typical
for
her
size
.
Thus
,
the
positive
cost
deviations
of
the
specimens
representing
Old
World
monkeys
and
apes
seem
possibly
attributable
to
their
immature
status
.
I
conclude
that
these
data
do
not
support
the
idea
that
the
cost
of
locomotion
in
primates
generally
,
or
in
Old
World
higher
primates
,
is
higher
than
that
of
a
generalized
endotherm
,
although
more
data
on
adult
Old
World
monkeys
and
apes
would
be
useful
.
Human
walking
,
however
,
uses
less
energy
than
that
of
either
nonhuman
primates
or
generalized
endotherms
.

observation
that
human
running
is
relatively
inefﬁcient
(
Taylor
et
al.
,
1982
;
Carrier
,
1984
;
Steudel
,
1994
,
1996
)
.
Three
(
of
seven
)
estimates
of
the
cost
of
human
running
,
however
,
actually
fall
below
the
line
based
on
the
general
equation
.
All
these
lower
estimates
are
from
studies
on
the
running
economy
of
highly
trained
distance
athletes
(
Conley
and
Krahenbuhl
,
1980
;
Daniels
and
Daniels
,
1992
)
.
Apparently
human
runners
specializing
in
long
distance
events
are
able
to
run
at
lower
costs
than
the
majority
of
their
conspeciﬁcs
.
Daniels
and
Daniels
(
1992
)
suggest
that
economy
may
“
determine
the
difference
in
performance
between
individuals
with
equal
or
near
equal
VO2maX
.
”
These
individuals
are
a
highly
select
subset
of
the
human
population
and
,
based
on
results
on
less
highly
trained
individuals
,
atypical
.
While
these
elite
athletes
may
differ
more
from
the
general
human
population
than
would
commonly
be
the
case
in
nature
,
it
is
interesting
that
several
estimates
of
locomotor
cost
on
a
single
species
can
produce
results
that
vary
so
widely
.
Nonetheless
,
it
is
widely
concluded
that
,
with
the
exception
of
highly
trained
athletes
,
the
cost
of
human
running
falls
above
the
line
based
on
the
generalized
model
(
Carrier
,
1984
;
Alexander
,
1991
;
Steudel
,
1994
,

)
.
An
equation
for
the
cost
of
locomotion
in
primates
In
addition
to
providing
a
general
equation
for
the
cost
of
locomotion
,
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
also
calculated
equations
based
on
various
subsets
of
their
sample
,
including
one
for
primates
.
Leonard
and
Robertson
(
1997
,
2001
)
have
used
this
primate
equation
to
argue
that
human
bipedal
locomotion
is
particularly
economical
in
comparison
to
what
would
be
expected
based
on
the
primate
equation
.
The
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
primate
equation
was
never
intended
to
focus
on
humans
.
They
used
the
primate
equation
solely
to
conclude
that
the
primate
equation
did
not
differ
from
that
of
the
general
equation
at
95
%
conﬁdence
.
Heglund
(
1985
)
subsequently
discussed
the
same
data
with
a
focus
on
primates
,
once
again
pointing
out
the
similarity
to
other
mammals
,
but
acknowledging
some
of
the
deviations
that
can
be
seen
in
Figs
.
1
and
2
.
He
downplayed
the
signiﬁcance
of
the
deviations
,
concluding
that
“
large
variations
in
this
cost
are
necessary
for
any
interspeciﬁc
arguments
about
adaptive
specializations
based
on
the
metabolic
cost
of
terrestrial
locomotion
”
(
p.
324
)
.
The
data
in
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
were
not
assembled
to
focus
on
human
locomotor
energetics
.
Most
of
the
primate
species
in
the
sample
were
quite
small
(
6
kg
or
less
)
.
Papio
is
represented
at
8.5
kg
,
Pan
at
17.5
kg
,
both
probably
juveniles
(
see
above
)
.
The
much
larger
Homo
is
represented
at
68.8
kg
(
see
their
Table
1
)
.
No
other
primate
species
similar
in
size
to
Homo
is
included
.
Fig.

shows
the

1
km

for
a
generalized
endotherm
(
solid
curve
)
based
on
the
equation
in
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
.
The
speed
of
2.5
m
s
’
1
was
chosen
because
it
is
near
the
energetically
optimal
speed
for
humans
to
change
gait
(
2.24
ms
”
,
Hreljac
,
1993
)
and
one
that
could
easily
be
used
by
animals
of
a
wide
range
of
sizes
.
The
dotted
curve
is
based
on
the
cost
to
locomote
at
2.5
m
s
’
1
for
each
primate
species
given
in
Taylor
et
al.
(

.
In
this
case
,
the
value
plotted
is
total

of
transport
,
rather
than
the
logarithmically
transformed
,
mass
speciﬁc
costs
shown
in
Figs

.
The
omission
of
logarithmic
transformation
has
two
conspicuous
and
predictable
effects
:
the
linearity
of
the
data
is
lost
and
the
size
differences
between
the
large
and
small
species

The
cost
to
travel
at
the

speed
for
a
variety
of
primate

The

human

The

The
inﬂuence
of
the
H.

point
is
readily
apparent
.
For
comparison
,
I
have
plotted
a
value
for
the
cost
for
a
human
to
walk
at
this
same
speed
,
based
on
Margaria
(
1938
)

lower
and
would
be
lower

if
the

were

.
become
much
more
apparent
.
Thus
,
it
becomes
evident
that
the
human
data
have
a
very
disproportionate
effect
on
the
curve
used
to
describe
the
primate
data
.
The
data
on
humans
cited
in
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
,
and
used
to
generate
the
primate
equation
,
are
the
classic
Margaria
et
al.
(
1963
)
data
on
human
running
.
Thus
,
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
estimate
the
cost
of
human
locomotion
as
43.4
%
above
that
expected
for
a
typical
quadruped
(
see
also
Alexander
,
1991
)
.
The
effect
of
these
data
are
particularly
pronounced
because
,
of
the
seven
estimates
of
the
cost
of
human
running
calculated
from
the
articles
cited
previously
and
plotted
in
Fig.
2
,
the
Margaria
et
al.
(
1963
)
data
give
the
single
highest
estimate
.
The
data
on
Pan
also
suggest
considerable
inefﬁciency
.
As
has
been
noted
,
the
specimens
of
Pan
on
which
cost
data
were
obtained
were
quite
clearly
juvenile
,
which
may
well
account
for
their
elevated
cost
.
Thus
,
the
two
data
points
representing
larger
body
weight
primates
both
suggest
inefﬁciency
,
while
cost
for
the
smaller
primate
species
are
similar
to
that
of
the
generalized
endotherm
.
Because
2.5
m
s
’
1
is
just
above
the
energetically
optimal
speed
to
switch
to
a
run
,
it
is
a
reasonable
speed
at
which
to
calculate
both
the
cost
of
human
running
and
of
human
walking
.
For
comparison
I
include
on
Fig.
3
an
estimate
of
the
cost
for
human
walking
based
on
data
in
Margaria
(
1938
)
.
Although
humans
would
normally
run
at
this
speed
,
the
drop
in
estimated
cost
for
human
walking
is
conspicuous
.
The
efﬁciency
of
human
walking
would
be
much
more
striking
at
a
speed
closer
to
energetic
optimality
.
Thus
,
the
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
equation
for
the
cost
of
locomotion
in
primates
is
heavily
inﬂuenced
by
the
inclusion
of
data
on
human
running
only
and
by
the
fact
that
H.
sapiens
is
the
only
large
body
sized

represented

based
on
the
Taylor

(

equation
would
predict

.
As
a
consequence
,

in
comparison
to
the
predictions
from

(
Leonard
and
Robertson

)
reﬂects
chieﬂy
the
great
differences
in

between

and

.
Summary
Arguments
that
bipedality
originated
in
our
lineage
as
a
strategy
to
mitigate
a
high
cost
of
locomotion
that
is
a
special
characteristic
of
nonhuman
primates
,
and
thus
our
ancestor
,
are
not
supported
by
existing
data
.
Estimates
of
the
cost
of
locomotion
in
primates
as
a
group
are
similar
to
that
of
generalized
endotherms
.
Human
walking
is
relatively
efﬁcient
,
either
in
comparison
to
other
primates
or
to
generalized
endotherms
.
Human
running
tends
to
be
less
efﬁcient
than
that
of
generalized
endotherms
except
in
the
case
of
elite
,
highly
trained
distance
athletes
.
The
equation
for
the
cost
of
primate
locomotion
developed
by
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
was
not
designed
for
studies
focusing
on
humans
.
H.
sapiens
was
the
only
large
body
sized
primate
on
which
they
had
data
and
these
data
were
for
the
relatively
inefﬁcient
human
running
.
Thus
,
comparing
the
cost
of
human
walking
to
a
prediction
from
the
Taylor
et
al.
(
1982
)
primate
equation
is
equivalent
to
comparing
the
cost
of
human
walking
to
that
of
human
running
.
