Implications
for
palaeoclimate
and

Abstract
Clay
mineralogy
of
a
60
m
thick
section
of
the
middle
Mingshui
Formation
(
upper
Campanian
to
lower
Maastrichtian
)
from
the
SKIn
borehole
(
Songliao
Basin
in
NE
China
)
has
been
studied
to
assess
the
palaeoclimate
and
provenance
.
The
sedimentary
succession
is
composed
of
shore
to
shallow
lacustrine
mudstones
and
siltstones
in
the
lower
part
,
and
meandering
fluvial
sandstone
–
mudstone
sequences
in
the
upper
part
.
The
clay
mineral
assemblage
is
characterized
by
the
predominance
of
smectitic
minerals
,
with
some
exceptions
of
illite-rich
layers
,
and
trace
amounts
of
kaolinite
and
chlorite
.
The
high
smectite
content
(
>
90
%
on
average
)
in
lacustrine
sediments
could
source
from
erosion
of
smetitic
soils
and
volcanic
materials
in
source
areas
.
The
Lesser
Xing
'
an
–
Zhangguangcai
Range
was
the
potential
provenance
area
for
the
sediments
,
with
volcanic
activity
occurring
at
~
70
Ma
,
when
the
temperate
semi-humid
palaeoclimate
was
favorable
for
the
clay
formation
.
Smectite
presented
in
meandering
fluvial
sandstones
is
of
early
diagenetic
origin
,
formed
by
hydrolysis
and
alteration
of
primary
minerals
after
deposition
.
Illite
in
overbank
deposits
is
interpreted
as
a
result
of
erosion
of
granitic
rocks
and
sorting
in
sedimentation
processes
.
The
clay
mineralogy
of
the
studied
strata
contains
information
on
palaeoclimate
and
provenance
,
although
early
diagenetic
processes
may
have
influenced
the
mineralogical
composition
in
some
intervals
of
sandstones
.

Introduction
The
Songliao
Basin
located
in
northeastern
China
is
a
rift
basin
filled
by
Cretaceous
,
predominantly
lacustrine
sediments
(
Chen
,
1987
,
Chen
and
Chang
,
1994
and
Wang
et
al.
,
2013
;
Fig.
1
)
.
The
lacustrine
deposits
,
which
are
up
to
ten-kilometers
thick
,
cover
an
area
of
260,000
km
2
.
They
provide
a
unique
opportunity
to
increase
our
understanding
of
the
Late
Cretaceous
continental
palaeoclimate
and
ecological
systems
.
A
sequence
of
about
2500
m
thick
of
middle
to
upper
Cretaceous
strata
was
cored
in
two
boreholes
in
the
Songliao
Basin
,
namely
the
SKIs
and
SKIn
boreholes
.
The
SKIs
core
recovered
strata
from
the
upper
Quantou
Formation
(
Turonian
)
to
the
Nenjiang
Formation
(
Santonian-Campanian
)
,
and
the
SKIn
core
recovered
strata
from
the
Nenjiang
Formation
to
the
Mingshui
Formation
(
Campanian-Maastrichtian
)
(
Wang
et
al.
,
2009
and
Wang
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
The
sedimentary
rocks
in
these
two
boreholes
were
subjected
to
a
variety
of
palaeontological
,
geochemical
,
sedimentological
and
palaeoclimotologic
studies
to
reconstruct
terrestrial
palaeoenvironments
and
palaeoclimate
changes
during
Cretaceous
greenhouse
world
(
Wang
et
al.
,
2008
and
Feng
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
Clay
minerals
in
continental
sediments
are
the
result
of
a
complex
interaction
of
several
factors
,
such
as
climate
and
weathering
,
source
area
lithology
,
mode
of
transport
and
depositional
environments
(
Chamley
,
1989
)
.
Clay
minerals
affected
by
no
more
than
early
diagenetic
processes
have
been
successfully
used
to
determine
the
provenance
and
palaeoclimate
in
a
variety
of
sedimentary
basins
(
Deconinck
et
al.
,
2000
,
Saèz
et
al.
,
2003
,
Suresh
et
al.
,
2004
,
Fesharaki
et
al.
,
2007
and
Do
Campo
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
However
,
in
some
basins
the
palaeoclimatic
signals
were
obscured
or
unrecognizable
due
to
diverse
factors
(
Singer
,
1984
,
Thiry
,
2000
and
Dera
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
The
Songliao
Basin
is
one
of
the
largest
oil
producing
basins
in
China
,
and
previous
studies
of
clay
minerals
in
Cretaceous
sediments
were
related
to
clay
diagenesis
of
petroleum
source
rocks
(
Wang
,
1988
,
Zhang
and
Gao
,
1997
and
Sun
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
Clay
minerals
were
seldom
used
to
retrieve
information
about
latest
Cretaceous
palaeoenvironments
and/or
palaeoclimate
.
The
principle
objective
of
this
paper
is
to
define
the
clay
mineralogy
of
a
60
m
section
of
the
middle
Mingshui
Formation
(
uppermost
Campanian
–
lower
Maastrichtian
)
in
the
SKIn
borehole
.
Clay
mineral
assemblages
in
this
section
are
useful
for
interpreting
the
latest
Cretaceous
palaeoclimate
and
sedimentary
provenance
of
this
basin
.

.
Geological
setting
The
Songliao
Basin
is
approximately
rhombic
in
shape
,
and
is
bordered
by
three
mountain
ranges
,
the
Xing
'
an
Range
on
the
west
,
the
Lesser
Xing
'
an
Range
on
the
north
and
the
Zhangguangcai
Range
on
the
east
(
Fig.
1
)
.
These
mountains
were
potential
source
areas
for
sediments
in
the
basin
.
The
Songliao
Basin
underwent
four
major
tectonic
events
:
mantle
upwelling
,
syn-rift
,
post-rift
thermal
subsidence
,
and
tectonic
inversion
(
Gao
and
Cai
,
1997
and
Feng
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
The
Mingshui
Formation
was
deposited
during
the
tectonic
inversion
phase
,
which
started
at
about
73
Ma
(
Zhang
et
al.
,
1996
and
Chi
et
al.
,
2002
)
,
in
response
to
the
interaction
between
the
Pacific
and
Eurasian
plates
(
Ren
et
al.
,
2002
,
Stepashko
,
2006
and
Muller
and
Maria
,
2008
)
.
This
sedimentary
formation
is
composed
of
a
sequence
of
alluvial
to
lacustrine
deposits
,
characterized
by
gray-green
,
gray
,
black
and
brown-red
mudstones
and
gray-green
sandstones
(
Wang
et
al.
,
2013
;
Fig.
2
)
.
According
to
the
biostratigraphic
,
palaeomagnetic
study
and
radioactive
dating
,
the
age
of
Mingshui
Formation
spans
from
the
middle
Campanian
to
the
Paleocene
(
Li
et
al.
,
2011
,
Scott
et
al.
,
2012
and
Wan
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
The
Mingshui
Formation
in
the
SKIn
borehole
is
about
576
m
thick
and
is
divided
into
two
members
.
Member
1
is
dominated
by
shore
to
shallow
lacustrine
siltstones
and
mudstones
,
and
Member
2
is
composed
of
alternating
deposits
of
meandering
rivers
and
shallow
lakes
(
Cheng
et
al.
,
2009
and
Cheng
et
al.
,
2011
)
.
The
palaeontological
,
sedimentological
and
stable
isotopic
records
of
the
Mingshui
Formation
demonstrate
that
a
semi-humid
temperate
climate
prevailed
during
the
Campanian
–
Maastrichtian
in
the
Songliao
Basin
and
adjacent
regions
(
Jerzykiewicz
,
1998
,
Gao
et
al.
,
1999
,
Chamberlain
et
al.
,
2013
and
Wang
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
The
studied
section
is
located
in
the
middle
of
the
Mingshui
Formation
,
at
the
depth
of
670
–
610
m
in
SKIn
borehole
,
crossing
the
boundary
of
the
two
members
(
Fig.
2
)
.
This
short
interval
was
selected
for
study
initially
because
it
was
thought
to
span
the
Cretaceous/Paleogene
(
K/Pg
)
boundary
,
which
was
later
disproved
.
The
lower
part
of
the
section
(
670
–
632
m
in
Member
1
)
is
composed
of
sediments
of
lacustrine
facies
.
In
the
bottom
10
m
,
the
shore
subfacies
consists
of
gray-greenish
mudstones
,
gray
siltstones
and
sandstones
,
with
horizontal
lamination
,
wave
bedding
,
and
small
planar
cross-bedding
.
The
shallow
lake
subfacies
consists
of
thicker
grayish
mudstones
intercalated
with
thin
siltstones
and
sandstones
.
The
upper
part
of
the
section
(
632
–
610
m
in
Member
2
)
is
composed
of
meandering
fluvial
deposits
of
thinning
upward
sandstones
and
mudstones
that
form
at
least
four
channel
sandstone
–
overbank
mudstone
sequences
.
The
channel
subfacies
consists
of
fine
to
medium
sandstones
with
parallel
bedding
,
trough
cross-bedding
,
and
scour
surface
.
The
overbank
subfacies
consists
of
mudstones
with
intercalated
thin
siltstones
,
with
lamination
,
wave
bedding
and
calcareous
concretion
.
The
age
of
the
boundary
between
Members
1
and
2
is
~
70.1
Ma
(
Scott
et
al.
,
2012
and
Wan
et
al.
,
2013
)
.

Materials
and
methods
Six
samples
were
collected
for
petrographic
studies
and
nineteen
samples
were
collected
for
mineralogical
analysis
.
The
sampling
was
focused
on
the
lithological
changes
along
the
section
.
Bulk
mineralogy
was
studied
using
X-ray
diffraction
(
XRD
)
at
the
Research
Institute
of
Petroleum
Exploration
and
Development
,
Petro
China
.
Randomly
orientated
powders
of
the
bulk
samples
were
prepared
for
XRD
analysis
on
a
Rigaku
D/MAX
2500
diffractometer
scanned
with
CuKα
radiation
,
under
a
voltage
of
40
kV
and
an
intensity
of
100
mA
.
Quantitative
estimation
of
the
bulk
mineralogy
used
the
method
of
Chung
(
1974
)
.
Two-hundred-and-eighty
samples
were
collected
for
clay
mineral
analysis
.
The
sampling
was
at
50
cm
intervals
in
the
lower
part
of
the
section
,
and
then
10
cm-interval
samples
were
taken
in
the
middle
part
because
this
section
was
previously
incorrectly
assumed
to
contain
the
K/Pg
boundary
.
Clay
minerals
were
studied
using
XRD
at
the
State
Key
Laboratory
of
Marine
Geology
,
Tongji
University
,
on
oriented
mounts
of
non-calcareous
clay-sized
particles
(
Holtzapffel
,
1985
)
.
Deflocculation
was
accomplished
by
successive
washing
with
distilled
water
after
decarbonation
with
0.2
N
HCl
,
and
then
particles
smaller
than
2
μm
were
separated
by
sedimentation
and
centrifuge
(
Liu
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
XRD
spectra
were
obtained
using
a
PANalytical
X'Pert
PRO
diffractometer
with
CuKα
radiation
and
Ni
filter
,
under
a
voltage
of
40
kV
and
an
intensity
of
25
mA
.
Three
XRD
runs
were
performed
,
following
air-drying
,
ethylene
–
glycol
solvation
for
24
h
,
and
heating
at
490
°
C
for
2
h.
Identification
of
clay
minerals
was
made
according
to
a
comprehensive
comparison
of
the
three
XRD
diffractograms
.
Semi-quantitative
calculations
were
carried
out
on
the
glycolated
curve
using
the
MacDiff
software
(
Petschick
et
al.
,
1996
and
Petschick
,
2000
)
.
The
relative
contents
of
each
clay
mineral
species
were
estimated
mainly
according
to
area
of
(
001
)
series
of
basal
reflections
,
i.e.
smectites
(
smectite
+
mixed
layers
)
(
17
A
)
,
illite
(
10
A
)
,
and
kaolinite/chlorite
(
7
A
)
.
Relative
proportions
of
kaolinite
and
chlorite
were
determined
using
the
ratios
of
the
3.57
/
3.54
A
peak
areas
.
According
to
the
XRD
results
,
eight
samples
were
selected
for
scanning
electron
microscopic
analysis
(
SEM
)
at
Chinese
Academy
of
Geological
Sciences
,
Beijing
.
Blocks
of
rock
samples
were
prepared
and
then
carbon
coated
.
The
analysis
was
undertaken
on
a
JSM-5610LV
scanning
electron
microscope
at
an
accelerating
voltage
of
20
kV
and
a
beam
current
of
1
–
3
nA
.
The
instrument
has
been
equipped
with
an
energy
dispersive
spectrometer
(
EDS
)
system
,
to
determine
the
chemical
composition
during
SEM
observations
.

Results
4.1
.
Petrography
Petrographic
thin-section
studies
reveal
that
angular
quartz
and
feldspar
grains
are
dominant
grains
of
sandstones
and
siltstones
in
the
studied
section
(
Fig.
3
A
,
C
,
D
)
.
Clasts
of
medium
to
silicic
volcanic
rocks
are
recognized
by
the
porphyritic
texture
and
plagioclase
phanerocrysts
(
Fig.
3
A
,
C
)
,
indicating
volcanic
activity
in
the
source
area
.
In
shallow
lacustrine
mudstones
,
very
fine
quartz
and
feldspar
grains
form
thin
laminae
(
Fig.
3
B
)
.
Sandstones
and
siltstones
of
meandering
rivers
are
cemented
by
calcite
(
Fig.
3
C
)
,
and
clay
mineral
rims
coat
some
clastic
grains
(
Fig.
3
D
)
.
4.2
.
Bulk
mineralogy
The
studied
sedimentary
succession
contains
phyllosilicates
,
quartz
,
plagioclase
,
K-feldspar
,
and
calcite
(
Fig.
4
)
.
The
mineralogical
distributions
partly
coincide
with
the
lithological
changes
(
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
3
)
.
In
the
lacustrine
sediments
from
the
lower
part
of
the
section
,
phyllosilicates
and
quartz
dominate
with
minor
plagioclase
and
traces
of
K-feldspar
and
calcite
.
Quartz
and
feldspars
are
more
abundant
in
the
basal
shore
siltstones
.
Phyllosilicate
content
decreases
in
fluvial
sediments
of
the
upper
part
of
the
section
,
which
is
associated
with
an
increase
in
quartz
,
plagioclase
and
K-feldspar
,
especially
in
sandstones
.
Calcites
also
mainly
occur
in
fluvial
sediments
due
to
its
authigenic
origin
as
cements
.
4.3
.
Clay
mineralogy
The
clay
fraction
of
the
studied
sedimentary
strata
is
composed
of
smectitic
minerals
(
including
random
illite/smectite
mixed-layers
(
I/S
)
and
smectite
)
,
illite
,
kaolinite
and
chlorite
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Smectite
is
the
predominant
clay
species
in
the
whole
succession
.
Illite
is
also
widely
distributed
but
its
proportion
changes
in
different
lithologies
.
Kaolinite
and
chlorite
are
negligible
in
most
samples
.
In
the
lower
part
of
the
section
,
the
predominant
smectite
gradually
increases
upward
,
from
81
%
average
in
shore
sediments
(
670
–
664
m
)
to
90
%
average
in
shallow
lacustrine
mudstones
(
664
–
645
m
)
,
and
the
clay
fraction
of
shallow
lacustrine
siltstones
is
almost
purely
smectite
(
645
to
632
m
)
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Smectite
is
relatively
well
preserved
as
indicated
by
the
shape
of
17A
peak
under
EG
condition
(
Fig.
6
A
)
.
Illite
,
kaolinite
and
chlorite
are
minor
minerals
in
shore
sediments
.
In
the
upper
part
of
the
section
,
the
clay
mineral
assemblage
changes
dramatically
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Smectite
is
still
abundant
especially
in
sandstones
and
siltstones
(
>
90
%
average
)
,
but
illite
peaks
significantly
in
two
intervals
with
an
average
of
79
%
and
50
%
respectively
.
It
is
noteworthy
that
the
illite-rich
layers
correspond
to
overbank
mudstones
or
silty
mudstones
,
which
may
be
related
to
their
origins
.
Smectite
in
sandstones
and
siltstones
is
well
crystallized
as
indicated
by
sharp
and
symmetric
peaks
(
Fig.
6
C
)
,
while
illite
in
mudstones
was
poorly
developed
(
Fig.
6
B
)
.
4.4
.
SEM
and
EDS
Different
clay
mineral
textures
are
revealed
by
SEM
.
In
samples
selected
from
lacustrine
deposits
at
670
–
640
m
,
which
contain
up
to

Discussion
Smectitic
minerals
are
the
predominant
clay
minerals
in
the
studied
succession
of
the
middle
part
of
the
Mingshui
Formation
,
except
for
several
illite-rich
layers
in
the
upper
part
of
the
section
.
The
smectitic
minerals
may
have
different
origins
,
such
as
detritus
from
the
erosion
of
parent
rocks
or
poorly
drained
soils
,
or
weathered
volcanic
rocks
,
or
being
of
diagenetic
origin
(
Chamley
,
1989
,
Deconinck
and
Chamley
,
1995
and
Wu
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
The
lacustrine
mudstones
and
sandstones
from
the
lower
part
of
the
section
(
670
–
632
m
)
are
mainly
composed
of
quartz
,
feldspars
and
few
lithic
fragments
(
Fig.
3
and
Fig.
4
)
,
predominantly
of
terrigenous
origin
.
Clay
minerals
in
this
part
show
poorly
developed
plates
and
exhibit
irregular
outline
or
ragged
edges
(
Fig.
5
A
)
,
or
show
a
flocculent
texture
where
the
almost
pure
smectite
is
present
(
Fig.
5
B
)
,
suggesting
that
the
clay
particles
were
abraded
and
disturbed
during
transportation
(
Hong
et
al.
,
2007
,
Arostegi
et
al.
,
2011
and
Wu
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
These
indicate
that
the
high
content
of
smectite
at
670
to
632
m
is
most
probably
of
detrital
origin
.
Reworking
of
smectitic
soils
may
be
a
potential
source
of
clay
input
into
sedimentary
basins
.
Well-developed
smectitic
soils
are
mostly
restricted
to
temperate
humid
to
sub-arid
climates
with
an
annual
precipitation
of
500
–
800
mm
and
with
a
well-marked
dry
season
,
along
with
poorly
drained
landscapes
(
Chamley
,
1989
and
Boulet
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
Clay
minerals
derived
from
such
soils
can
be
used
to
reconstruct
the
climate
of
the
source
areas
(
Chamley
,
1989
)
.
Currently
northeast
China
is
under
the
influence
of
a
monsoonal
system
and
is
characterized
by
a
temperate
,
humid
to
semi-arid
climate
(
Zhang
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
Modern
black
and
albic
soils
in
northeastern
China
are
predominately
montmorillonite
and
kaolinite
in
clay
mineral
composition
(
Juan
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
agricultural
regions
of
NE
China
clays
are
predominantly
smectite
–
illite
mixed
layers
,
illites
and
kaolinites
,
although
the
composition
may
change
at
different
latitudes
(
Zheng
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
early
Maastrichtian
at
about
70
Ma
,
a
temperate
semi-humid
climate
prevailed
in
the
Songliao
Basin
as
indicated
by
studies
of
spores
and
pollens
,
climate
sensitive
sedimentary
rocks
and
stable
isotopes
(
Gao
et
al.
,
1999
,
Chamberlain
et
al.
,
2013
and
Wang
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
The
palaeoclimate
was
similar
to
present
day
climate
,
which
favors
the
development
of
smectite-rich
soils
.
However
,
the
smectite-rich
soils
always
contain
kaolinite
(
Buhmann
and
Schoeman
,
1995
,
Juan
et
al.
,
2010
and
Zheng
et
al.
,
2010
)
,
and
the
studied
uppermost
Cretaceous
strata
in
the
Songliao
Basin
have
negligible
amounts
of
kaolinite
,
except
for
two
samples
,
where
kaolinite
comprises
less
than
20
%
.
Therefore
,
it
is
uncertain
whether
the
smectitic
minerals
in
the
Mingshui
Formation
are
solely
derived
from
the
erosion
of
smectite-rich
soils
,
or
if
other
sources
contributed
to
the
high
smectite
content
.
Volcaniclastics
can
easily
be
transformed
into
smectite
during
early
diagenesis
(
Cuadros
et
al.
,
1999
)
,
thus
providing
another
possible
source
of
clay
minerals
in
sedimentary
basins
(
Lindgreen
and
Surlyk
,
2000
,
Jeans
et
al.
,
2000
and
Shoval
,
2004
)
.
The
volcanogenic
smectites
are
almost
always
associated
with
tuff
layers
in
sedimentary
sequences
(
Deconinck
et
al.
,
2005
and
Do
Campo
et
al.
,
2010
)
,
but
in
the
studied
section
of
the
SKIn
borehole
no
obvious
volcanic
ash
layers
were
found
.
Smectites
can
be
also
derived
from
volcanic
rocks
altered
in
source
areas
and
then
transported
into
the
basin
.
Volcaniclastic
input
into
the
sediment
composition
is
indicated
by
the
presence
of
volcanic
fragments
in
lacustrine
sediments
(
Fig.
3
)
.
Previous
geologic
studies
show
that
the
eastern
Songliao
Basin
experienced
regional
uplift
and
weak
structural
inversion
during
late
Cretaceous
,
which
resulted
in
an
abrupt
change
from
deep
lacustrine
deposition
to
fluvial
and
floodplain
environments
with
only
local
shallow
lakes
on
the
alluvial
plain
(
Liu
et
al.
,
1993
and
Feng
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
Sedimentological
and
geophysical
(
mainly
seismic
reflection
)
evidences
show
that
after
~
80
Ma
the
direction
of
the
main
provenance
changed
from
north
to
east
–
west
,
when
large
meandering
deltaic
deposits
developed
in
eastern
Songliao
Basin
(
Liu
et
al.
,
1993
,
Zhang
et
al.
,
2009
,
Cheng
et
al.
,
2009
,
Feng
et
al.
,
2010
and
Zhao
et
al.
,
2013
;
Fig.
1
)
.
This
suggests
that
the
Lesser
Xing
'
an
–
Zhangguangcai
Range
became
the
main
source
area
for
sediments
transported
to
the
Songliao
Basin
.
The
rocks
exposed
in
Lesser
Xing
'
an
–
Zhangguangcai
Range
are
dominated
by
granites
now
(
Wu
et
al.
,
2011
)
,
which
tend
to
form
illites
and
kaolinites
under
physical
and
chemical
weathering
conditions
(
Chamley
,
1989
)
.
A
large
set
of
data
indicates
that
in
Early
Cretaceous
,
sedimentary
basins
east
of
the
Zhangguangcai
Range
received
abundant
volcanic
materials
from
the
Lesser
Xing
'
an
–
Zhangguangcai
Range
(
Ren
et
al.
,
2005
,
Yang
et
al.
,
2006
,
Wen
et
al.
,
2008
and
Wen
et
al.
,
2011
)
,
and
such
supplies
continued
into
the
Late
Cretaceous
(
Wen
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
The
SKIn
site
is
located
to
the
west
of
the
Lesser
Xing
'
an
–
Zhangguangcai
Range
and
could
also
have
received
volcanic
materials
.
The
presence
of
volcanic
fragments
in
the
middle
Mingshui
Formation
and
the
slightly
higher
Fe
2
+
/
Fe
3
+
and
Mg
2
+
composition
of
clay
minerals
(
Table
1
)
further
support
this
hypothesis
.
In
addition
,
the
temperate
semi-humid
climatic
conditions
during
early
Maastrichtian
were
favorable
for
weathering
of
volcanic
materials
and
their
alteration
into
smectites
.
Therefore
,
it
is
likely
that
the
high
content
of
smectite
in
lacustrine
deposits
was
eroded
from
volcanic
materials
in
the
source
areas
under
temperate
semi-humid
climate
.
However
,
because
no
obvious
volcanic
ash
layers
are
found
in
the
sequence
and
the
ferruginous
and
magnesian
compositions
are
not
significantly
high
,
it
is
possible
that
some
Mingshui
smectite
was
also
eroded
from
smectitic
soils
.
As
stated
above
,
erosion
of
smectitic
soils
and
volcanic
weathering
are
both
probable
origins
of
high
content
smectitic
minerals
in
lacustrine
deposits
from
the
lower
part
of
the
studied
section
.
Whatever
the
origin
was
,
a
temperate
semi-humid
climate
was
necessary
for
smectite
formation
,
which
is
in
accordance
with
previous
palaeontological
,
sedimentological
and
stable
isotopic
studies
(
Wang
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
Smectites
in
the
meandering
fluvial
deposits
from
the
upper
part
of
the
section
have
a
different
crystalline
morphology
than
the
clays
from
the
underlying
lacustrine
deposits
(
Fig.
7
)
.
The
‘
honeycomb
’
and
‘
flake
’
habits
of
smectites
shown
by
SEM
(
Fig.
7
D
,
F
)
,
and
the
coating
of
detrital
grains
(
Fig.
7
E
)
may
indicate
that
smectites
were
formed
predominantly
in
situ
(
Chamley
,
1989
and
Fesharaki
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
smectites
in
the
sandstones
are
considered
to
be
of
early
diagenetic
origin
,
resulting
from
hydrolysis
and
alteration
of
primary
feldspars
and
muscovites
after
sediment
deposition
(
Fesharaki
,
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
illite-rich
layers
in
the
upper
part
of
the
sampled
interval
differ
from
the
dominant
smectitic
mineral
background
of
the
whole
section
.
Correlation
with
lithology
shows
that
illite
content
is
higher
in
finer
grained
,
darker
colored
mudstones
and
silty
mudstones
of
overbank
subfacies
,
in
the
intervals
of
667
–
668
m
,
625
–
628
m
,
621
m
and
611
–
613
m
(
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
5
)
.
SEM
analysis
demonstrates
that
clays
at
these
depths
are
mostly
of
detrital
origin
(
Fig.
7
C
)
.
Contrast
in
clay
mineral
assemblages
dominated
by
either
smectitic
or
illitic
minerals
in
different
facies
indicate
that
they
were
derived
from
different
sources
(
Suresh
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
For
example
,
in
the
Himalayan
foreland
basin
,
high
amounts
of
illite
with
rare
to
absent
smectite
content
in
buff
sandstones
and
mudstones
indicate
that
the
source
was
the
piedmont
drainage
that
originated
from
the
near-by
Sub-Himalaya
(
Ghosh
et
al.
,
2003
and
Suresh
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
It
is
also
noteworthy
that
differential
sorting
of
clay
minerals
during
sedimentation
processes
were
thought
to
explain
the
gradual
illite
and
smectite
enrichment
of
clay
minerals
away
from
the
major
river
mouths
(
Chamley
,
1989
and
Thiry
,
2000
)
.
Although
not
systematically
investigated
,
some
studies
show
that
illite
,
smectite
–
illite
mixed
layers
and
kaolinite
dominate
clay
mineral
assemblage
in
sediments
of
modern
Songhuajiang
River
,
which
is
one
of
the
largest
rivers
in
northeastern
China
,
and
the
source
is
erosion
of
granitic
rocks
surrounding
the
basin
(
Wang
,
2007
)
.
During
deposition
of
the
middle
Mingshui
Formation
,
the
higher
amount
of
illite
in
overbank
deposits
was
probably
derived
from
the
granitoids
weathering
in
nearby
source
areas
,
and
the
lateral
sorting
of
illite
from
smectite
during
sedimentation
may
further
enrich
the
illite
content
.

Conclusions
Clay
mineralogy
of
the
middle
Mingshui
Formation
(
upper
Campanian
–
lower
Maastrichtian
)
was
studied
in
the
SKIn
borehole
located
in
the
Songliao
Basin
(
NE
China
)
.
Studied
strata
are
characterized
by
a
dominance
of
smectitic
clay
minerals
,
with
few
illite-rich
layers
.
Kaolinite
and
chlorite
occur
only
in
trace
amounts
.
Different
origins
of
the
clay
species
are
distinguished
based
on
the
clay
assemblages
,
clay
crystal
morphology
,
geochemical
composition
and
correlation
between
clays
and
sedimentary
facies
.
The
high
smectite
content
(
>
90
%
on
average
)
in
shore
to
shallow
lacustrine
mudstones
and
siltstones
was
sourced
by
erosion
of
smetitic
soils
and
volcanic
materials
in
the
source
areas
.
The
Lesser
Xing
'
an
–
Zhangguangcai
Range
was
the
potential
provenance
area
supplying
volcanic
materials
at
~
70
Ma
time
period
,
when
the
temperate
semi-humid
palaeoclimate
was
favorable
for
the
clay
formation
.
Smectite
in
meandering
fluvial
sandstones
is
of
early
diagenetic
origin
,
formed
by
hydrolysis
and
alteration
of
primary
minerals
such
as
of
feldspars
.
Clays
with
more
illite
correlating
to
overbank
deposits
were
probably
derived
from
the
erosion
of
granitic
rocks
in
nearby
source
areas
and
sorting
in
sedimentation
processes
.
It
is
concluded
that
clay
minerals
in
the
Upper
Cretaceous
Mingshui
Formation
in
the
Songliao
Basin
contain
information
on
palaeoclimate
and
provenance
,
although
early
diagenetic
processes
may
have
influenced
the
mineralogical
composition
in
some
intervals
of
sandstones
.
