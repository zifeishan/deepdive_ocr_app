Calcareous

:
diversity
,
distribution
,
ecology
and
potential
for
palaeoenvironmental
reconstruction
Abstract
Several
marine
,
peridiniphycidean
dinoflagellate
species
produce
calcareous
cysts
during
their
life
cycle
,
which
are
relatively
resistant
to
chemical
and
physical
degradation
and
are
therefore
often
found
in
large
quantities
in
oceanic
bottom
sediments
.
Although
the
use
of
these
calcareous
cysts
as
proxies
for
palaeoenvironmental
and
palaeoclimatic
reconstructions
has
seen
many
advances
over
the
last
decade
,
until
now
only
relatively
patchy
and
regional
information
was
available
on
their
recent
distribution
patterns
and
ecology
,
especially
at
the
species
level
.
In
this
paper
,
comprehensive
calcareous
cyst
diversity
and
distribution
data
have
been
compiled
from
published
and
unpublished
work
for
167
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
Ocean
surface
sediments
,
ranging
from
20
°
N
to
50
°
S
,
and
30
°
E
to
65
°
W
.
The
main
aim
has
been
to
focus
on
the
complex
,
often
non-linear
,
relationships
between
individual
species
’
distributions
and
the
physicochemical
and
trophic
conditions
of
the
overlying
(
sub
)
surface
waters
through
the
use
of
x
–
y
graphs
of
cyst
abundance
vs.
(
sub
)
surface
water
environmental
parameters
,
and
detrended
correspondence
analyses
.
Ten
cyst
species
and
the
calcareous
vegetative
coccoid
species
Thoracosphaera
heimii
were
observed
in
the
bottom
sediments
,
each
species
showing
its
own
characteristic
distribution
pattern
in
relation
to
the
environmental
conditions
of
the
upper
water
masses
above
them
(
e.g.
sea
surface
temperature
,
productivity
,
stratification
)
.
The
sensitive
reactions
of
various
species
to
unique
combinations
of
environmental
parameters
shows
that
each
species
has
its
own
specific
ecological
traits
,
thus
rejecting
the
bundled
use
of
‘
calcareous
cyst
accumulation
’
as
a
general
proxy
for
oligotrophy
or
stratification
in
future
palaeoenvironmental
analyses
.
The
acquired
‘
reference
’
data
set
of
this
study
is
large
and
diverse
enough
to
allow
its
future
application
in
quantitative
palaeoenvironmental
reconstruction
models
,
and
shows
that
there
is
still
an
enormous
reconstruction
potential
concealed
in
many
fossil
calcareous
dinoflagellate
cyst
assemblages
.

Introduction
Many
dinoflagellate
species
produce
geologically
preservable
cysts
(
dinocysts
)
as
part
of
their
life
cycle
.
Although
most
of
these
dinocysts
are
organic-walled
,
about
30
modern
species
have
so
far
been
found
to
incorporate
calcite
into
their
cyst
wall
(
Table
1
)
.
Of
these
,
most
species
have
been
described
from
neritic
waters
,
but
ongoing
research
,
especially
at
the
University
of
Bremen
,
has
shown
that
several
calcareous
cyst-producing
dinoflagellate
species
are
extremely
abundant
in
tropical
,
subtropical
and
temperate
oceanic
(
sub
)
surface
waters
as
well
.
Only
limited
species-specific
information
is
as
yet
available
on
modern
calcareous
dinocyst
distributions
and
their
corresponding
environmental
affinities
,
despite
the
fact
that
they
can
overwhelmingly
dominate
the
total
dinocyst
flux
to
the
seafloor
in
many
regions
(
e.g.
Dale
,
1992a
,
Höll
et
al.
,
1998
and
Montresor
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
This
is
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
studies
carried
out
on
late
Quaternary
and
modern
calcareous
dinocysts
so
far
have
been
of
taxonomic
(
e.g.
Kamptner
,
1963
,
Kamptner
,
1967
,
Wall
and
Dale
,
1968
,
D’Onofrio
et
al.
,
1999
,
Janofske
,
2000
and
Meier
et
al.
,
2002
)
or
biological
(
e.g.
Binder
and
Anderson
,
1987
and
Ishikawa
and
Taniguchi
,
1996
)
,
rather
than
of
ecological
,
character
.
For
example
,
the
calcareous
cyst-producing
dinoflagellate
Scrippsiella
trochoidea
and
its
related
forms
have
received
special
attention
from
plankton
specialists
and
physiologists
;
partly
because
they
are
relatively
easy
to
maintain
in
culture
(
e.g.
Binder
and
Anderson
,
1987
,
Binder
and
Anderson
,
1990
,
Costas
and
Varela
,
1989
,
Montresor
et
al.
,
1994
,
Ishikawa
and
Taniguchi
,
1996
and
Rengefors
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
Based
on
the
surprisingly
high
rates
of
calcareous
dinocyst
accumulation
in
sediment
traps
of
the
Pacific
and
Atlantic
open
oceans
,
Dale
,
1992a
and
Dale
,
1992b
already
pointed
out
that
calcareous
dinocysts
probably
offer
the
most
representative
palaeoecological
record
of
all
oceanic
dinoflagellates
in
deep-sea
sediments
.
These
results
,
which
clearly
hint
at
the
potential
use
of
calcareous
dinocysts
for
palaeoenvironmental
reconstruction
,
stimulated
the
development
of
ecological
studies
on
Quaternary
and
modern
oceanic
calcareous
dinocysts
over
the
last
few
years
(
Höll
et
al.
,
1998
,
Höll
et
al.
,
1999
,
Zonneveld
et
al.
,
2000
,
Vink
et
al.
,
2000
,
Vink
et
al.
,
2002
,
Vink
et
al.
,
2003
,
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
,
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002b
and
Meier
and
Willems
,
2003
)
.
It
is
generally
assumed
that
all
calcareous
dinocysts
are
produced
by
peridiniphycidean
dinoflagellates
which
are
autotrophic
(
e.g.
Binder
and
Anderson
,
1987
and
Montresor
et
al.
,
1994
)
,
suggesting
that
they
live
in
the
upper
water
column
where
enough
light
is
available
for
photosynthesis
.
Thus
,
it
may
be
assumed
that
their
production
and
abundance
will
be
primarily
determined
by
the
environmental
properties
of
the
(
sub
)
surface
waters
.
The
motile
,
thecate
dinoflagellates
increase
their
biomass
in
the
upper
water
column
through
simple
cell
division
(
i.e.
asexual/vegetative
reproduction
)
,
but
under
certain
circumstances
undergo
sexual
reproduction
in
which
dormant
,
immobile
,
calcareous
cysts
are
produced
.
Calcareous
cyst
production
rates
and
the
factors
inducing
encystment
are
not
well
constrained
,
but
for
species
available
in
culture
at
the
University
of
Bremen
(
e.g.
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
,
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
Leonella
granifera
)
,
cysts
are
formed
every
few
days
to
weeks
,
the
motile
rather
than
the
cyst
phase
forming
the
dominant
life
stage
(
Janofske
and
Karwath
,
2000
)
.
As
such
,
calcareous
cyst-producing
dinoflagellates
clearly
have
a
life
strategy
different
from
that
of
the
extremely
abundant
and
small-sized
mono-generic
dinoflagellate
species
Thoracosphaera
heimii
,
which
produces
immobile
,
calcareous
coccoids/shells
during
the
asexual
rather
than
the
sexual
life
cycle
(
Tangen
et
al.
,
1982
)
.
A
new
shell
is
formed
for
every
cell
division
,
so
that
the
cells
of
T.
heimii
spend
most
of
their
time
in
the
shell
rather
than
being
mobile
.
The
cells
show
extremely
high
production
rates
of
up
to
one
division
per
day
(
Tangen
et
al.
,
1982
and
Dale
,
1992b
)
.
Due
to
the
differences
in
taxonomic
affinity
,
reproductive
strategy
and
production
rate
,
it
is
thus
essential
to
deal
with
shells
of
T.
heimii
separately
when
interpreting
sediment
cyst
abundances
.
Although
this
paper
focuses
mainly
on
the
ecological
and
environmental
affinities
of
the
calcareous
cyst
species
,
T.
heimii
distributions
have
been
included
as
they
can
also
provide
valuable
(
palaeo
)
environmental
information
.
Calcareous
dinocysts
and
Thoracosphaera
heimii
occur
in
many
different
environments
ranging
from
the
tropics
to
the
sub-arctic
,
but
generally
occur
in
the
greatest
diversity
and
abundance
in
tropical
and
subtropical
regions
.
Field
studies
carried
out
in
the
equatorial
Atlantic
show
that
the
greatest
number
of
full
shells
of
T.
heimii
occur
at
water
depths
between
50
and
100
m
,
coincident
with
the
uppermost
part
of
the
thermo
-
/
pycnocline
(
Karwath
et
al.
,
2000a
)
.
Although
the
density
differences
associated
with
the
pycnocline
undoubtedly
aid
the
collection
of
full
shells
at
this
depth
to
some
extent
,
T.
heimii
cycles
quickly
between
its
motile
and
shell
phase
and
therefore
most
likely
inhabits
this
lower
part
of
the
photic
zone
where
less
light
but
more
nutrients
are
available
(
Karwath
et
al.
,
2000a
)
.
It
is
assumed
that
several
of
the
calcareous
dinocyst
species
are
produced
and/or
collected
at
similar
water
depths
,
that
is
,
within
or
just
above
the
thermocline
(
Janofske
and
Kartwath
,
2000
,
Vink
et
al.
,
2000
and
Vink
et
al.
,
2002
;
A.
Vink

unpubl
.
data
from
western
North
Atlantic
subsurface
water
samples
)
.
Most
species
show
relatively
widespread
geographic
distributions
through
many
different
temperature
and
salinity
regimes
of
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
(
Zonneveld
et
al.
,
2000
,
Karwath
et
al.
,
2000a
and
Karwath
et
al.
,
2000b
;
this
study
)
.
Nevertheless
,
Vink
et
al.
(
2000
)
show
that
differences
in
species
’
distributions
in
western
equatorial
Atlantic
surface
sediments
reflect
the
different
surface
water
masses
of
the
area
,
and
this
information
can
be
used
to
trace
spatial
shifts
in
the
positions
of
the
main
surface
currents
during
the
late
Quaternary
(
Vink
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
Suggestions
have
been
made
that
cyst
and
T.
heimii
production
is
enhanced
under
stratified
,
oligotrophic
(
sub
)
surface
water
conditions
(
e.g.
Höll
et
al.
,
1999
,
Esper
et
al.
,
2000
and
Vink
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
Consequent
analysis
of
a
multi-proxy
core
from
the
Ceará
Rise
offshore
northern
Brazil
showed
that
stratification
of
the
upper
water
column
and
the
presence
of
a
well-developed
thermocline
are
probably
the
most
important
factors
controlling
general
cyst
and
T.
heimii
distribution
in
the
equatorial
Atlantic
,
whereas
the
state
of
oligotrophy
may
secondarily
influence
production
within
a
well-stratified
environment
(
Vink
et
al.
,
2002
)
.
Similar
results
were
obtained
from
surface
sediment
and
sediment
trap
analyses
off
Somalia
,
where
a
negative
relationship
between
primary
productivity
and
cyst
/
T.
heimii
accumulation
could
not
be
confirmed
,
whereas
strong
turbulence
and
high
current
speeds
were
unfavourable
for
production
and
accumulation
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
and
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002b
)
.
The
main
aim
in
determining
the
environmental
affinities
of
the
different
calcareous
cyst
species
and
Thoracosphaera
heimii
is
to
use
their
down-core
abundance
changes
to
reflect
past
environmental
and
oceanographic
changes
,
to
hypothesise
about
the
possible
causes
of
such
changes
and
their
effects
on
past
and
future
climate
change
.
However
,
such
studies
based
on
calcareous
dinocysts
are
still
hampered
by
the
scarcity
of
detailed
knowledge
concerning
their
exact
autecology
and
synecology
.
As
numerous
factors
may
influence
the
associations
between
the
times
of
production
and
deposition
(
e.g.
zooplankton
grazing
,
lateral
transport
in
the
water
column
,
(
selective
)
dissolution
in
the
water
column
and/or
at
the
sediment
–
water
interface
,
sediment
redistribution
,
bioturbation
)
,
the
original
production
signal
of
most
dinocysts
is
likely
overprinted
by
other
information
once
sedimentation
occurs
,
leading
to
plankton
–
sediment
mismatching
.
Any
studies
involving
the
traditional
approach
of
comparing
surface
sediment
distributions
with
the
environmental
conditions
of
the
overlying
(
sub
)
surface
water
masses
to
obtain
ecological
information
should
thus
involve
as
large
a
data
set
as
possible
,
so
that
inconsistencies
caused
by
any
of
the
above-mentioned
post-production
processes
are
not
weighted
so
heavily
,
or
can
even
be
discerned
.
Such
large
data
sets
,
deriving
from
a
wide
spectrum
of
environmental
settings
,
can
consequently
be
used
in
quantitative
models
to
predict
past
(
sub
)
surface
water
conditions
(
as
has
,
for
example
,
been
done
for
planktonic
foraminifera
using
the
transfer
function
technique
:
Imbrie
and
Kipp
,
1971
and
Pflaumann
et
al.
,
1996
)
,
although
for
calcareous
dinocysts
a
more
detailed
knowledge
of
the
distributions
of
their
living
counterparts
in
the
upper
water
column
is
still
required
to
exactly
pinpoint
their
preferred
depth
habitat
.
In
this
paper
,
the
diversity
and
distribution
patterns
of
calcareous
dinocyst
species
and
Thoracosphaera
heimii
are
described
from
167
surface
sediment
samples
deriving
from
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
Ocean
between
20
°
N
and
50
°
S
,
and
30
°
E
and
65
°
W
(
Fig.

)
.
Only
very
few
of
these
samples
derive
from
neritic
areas
,
the
majority
are
from
open
ocean
regions
.
Parts
of
the
data
set
used
in
this
study
have
already
been
published
elsewhere
,
i.e.
37
of
the
western
equatorial
Atlantic
samples
were
published
by
Vink
et
al.
(
2000
)
and
36
of
the
mainly
SE
Atlantic
samples
were
published
by
Zonneveld
et
al.
(
2000
)
.
In
addition
,
a
brief
account
of
the
distributions
of
the
most
common
cyst
species
and
T.
heimii
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
,
and
possible
synecological
links
with
coccolithophorid
and
planktonic
foraminiferal
species
,
are
given
in
a
synthesis
paper
of
Vink
et
al.
(
2003
)
.
However
,
in
contrast
to
Vink
et
al.
(
2003
)
,
this
paper
focuses
on
the
detailed
,
multiple-sample
statistical
comparison
of
each
of
the
species
distributions
with
the
main
physicochemical
and
trophic
conditions
of
the
overlying
(
sub
)
surface
waters
(
at
0
and
75
m
water
depth
)
,
through
the
use
of
x
–
y
graphs
of
abundance
vs.
environmental
parameters
,
and
detrended
correspondence
analyses
.
These
processes
allow
a
comprehensive
ecological
calibration
of
species
to
each
other
and
to
the
modern
surface
water
currents
and
conditions
,
and
have
led
to
the
development
of
a
large
ecological
reference
data
set
which
should
be
of
great
help
in
future
palaeoenvironmental
and
palaeoceanographic
reconstructions
,
be
it
through
the
use
of
abundance
fluctuations
of
particular
indicator
species
or
through
its
future
application
in
quantitative
,
palaeoenvironmental
models

Statistical

Geographic

of
Thoracosphaera
heimii
and
the
calcareous
dinocyst
species
present
in
the
surface

the

.
Relative
instead
of
absolute
cyst
abundances
were
generally
used
,
because
of
the
greatly
fluctuating
sedimentation
rates
in
the
regions
studied
,
varying
from
<

over
the

.
Problems
associated
with
relative
abundances
and
the
so-called
‘
closed-sum
effect
’
,
i.e.
many
of
the
dominating
species
have
widespread
geographic
ranges
and
tend
to
suppress
the
patterns
shown
by
less
abundant
species
,
are
assumed
to
be
smaller
than
the
artefacts
which
would
arise
from
the
absolute
data
because
of
variable
sedimentary
dilution
.
T.
heimii
counts
have
not
been
included
in
the
percentage

calculations
of
the
dinocyst
species
.
To
additionally
determine
which
specific
environmental
gradients
have
the
most
significant
control
on
the
distribution
pattern
of
each
species
,
a
detrended
correspondence
analysis
(
DCA
)
was
applied
on
the
percentage

set
of
the
calcareous

DCA
is
a
form
of
indirect
gradient
analysis
in
which
species
are
arranged
along
axes
in
such
a
way
that
the
first
axis
(
or
x
-
axis
)
represents
an
unknown
,
theoretical
environmental
gradient
(
or
a
combination
of
gradients
)
which
causes
the
largest
variation
in
species
composition
,
and
the
second
axis
(
or
y
-
axis
)
represents
the
second-most
important
direction
of
variation
.
Species
which
are
plotted
close
to
each
other
in
such
an
analysis
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
same
set
of
samples
and
thus
have
similar
distribution
patterns
,
whereas
species
plotted
far
apart
from
each
other
tend
towards
different
distribution
patterns
.
To
test
which
environmental
variables
play
an
important
role
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
species
distribution
,
the
species
arrangements
are
related
to
known
environmental
variables
of
the
upper
water
column
(
e.g.
temperature
,
salinity
,
nutrient
concentration
)
through
the
linear
regression
of
these
variables
onto
the
DCA-axes
(
Fig.
12
)
.
The
direction
and
the
length
of
the
line
representing
a
variable
are
indicative
of
its
importance
in
determining
the
species
composition
:
a
long
line
running
almost
parallel
to
one
of
the
two
DCA
axes
is
most
likely
to
influence
the
species
distribution
significantly
.
The
same
environmental
variables
as
those
used
for
the
x
–
y
plots
were
used
as
input
(
these
are
summarised
in
Table

)
.
Annual
rather
than
seasonal
data
were
used
due
to
the
great
amount
of
covariation
which
arose
among
seasons

Calcareous
dinocyst
diversity
and
geographic
distribution
Ten
calcareous
dinocyst
species
were
observed
regularly
and/or
in
high
abundances
in
the
predominantly
oceanic
surface
sediment
samples
of
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
;
these
are
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
,
paratabulated
C.
albatrosianum
,
Calciodinellum
levantinum
,
Calciodinellum
elongatum
,
Leonella
granifera
,
Scrippsiella
regalis
,
Rhabdothorax
sp.
,
Caracomia
arctica
and
Melodomuncula
berlinensis
(
see
Appendix
B
and
Plate
I
,
Plate
II
and
Plate
III
for
taxonomic
information
)
.
The
geographic
distributions
of
these
species
are
illustrated
in
Fig.

,
Fig.

,
Fig.

and

.
Absolute
concentrations
of
dinocysts
,
in
cysts
g
−
1
of
dry
sediment
,
are
depicted
in
Fig.
3a
only
.
Relatively
high
concentrations
(
generally
exceeding
50
000
cysts
g
−
1
and
often
reaching
values
>
500
000
cysts
g
−
1
)
are
recorded
in
many
of
the
samples
located
between
the
latitudes
of
20
°
N
and
approximately
35
°
S.
Further
south
,
the
few
sample
points
which
I
have
reflect
lower
cyst
concentrations
(
<
20
000
cysts
g
−
1
)
.
Very
few
samples
are
barren
,
of
which
most
are
located
either
below
the
calcite
lysocline
(
e.g.
samples
GeoB
3906
,
4319
and
5201
in
the
Brazil
Basin
;
GeoB
1724
and
2011
in
the
Cape
Basin
)
,
or
in
shallow
waters
where
river
input
of
sand
,
nutrients
and
fresh
water
are
apparently
unfavourable
for
cyst
production
or
preservation
(
e.g.
samples
GeoB
3916
and
3918
in
the
Amazon
River
mouth
;
GeoB
6301
in
the
Rio
de
la
Plata
)
.
Fig.
3a
shows
that
cyst
concentrations
are
highest
in
the
mid-Atlantic
Ridge
samples
(
with
the
exception
of
the
equatorial
upwelling
area
)
.
Furthermore
,
concentrations
are
higher
in
the
western
part
of
the
Atlantic
Basin
(
mean
concentration
in
54
samples
:
391
568
cysts
g
−
1
)
than
in
the
eastern
part
(
mean
concentration
in
50
samples
:
111
726
cysts
g
−
1
)
.
As
such
,
it
is
tempting
to
associate
high
calcareous
dinocyst
production
with
the
relatively
warm
,
oligotrophic-to-mesotrophic
,
oceanic
surface
waters
which
predominate
in
most
regions
of
high
sedimentary
cyst
concentration
.
However
,
cyst
concentrations
are
strongly
biased
by
large
differences
in
sedimentation
rate
,
which
are
,
for
example
,
often
reduced
to
<
2
cm
ka
−
1
over
the
mid-Atlantic
Ridge
(
e.g.
Berger
,
1985
and
Pätzold
et
al.
,
1999
)
whereas
they
are
higher
in
the
western
Atlantic
and
often
reach
values
>
15
cm
ka
−
1
in
the
high
productivity
regions
of
the
eastern
Atlantic
(
e.g.
Gingele
and
Dahmke
,
1994
and
Summerhayes
et
al.
,
1995
)
.
Thus
,
differential
sedimentation
rates
clearly
determine
a
large
part
of
the
pattern
of
absolute
abundances
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
extremely
misleading
to
interpret
cyst
fluxes
to
the
sediment
through
the
analysis
of
cyst
concentrations
only
.
Absolute
abundances
of
Thoracosphaera
heimii
show
a
strikingly
similar
distribution
pattern
to
that
of
the
cysts
,
also
being
determined
mainly
by
the
rates
of
sedimentation
.
Due
to
the
lack
of
trustworthy
information
on
sedimentation
rates
,
I
have
therefore
refrained
from
using
dinocyst
or
T.
heimii
fluxes
,
and
decided
to
work
with
relative
abundances
of
species
instead
.
The
distributions
of
Thoracosphaera
heimii
(
Fig.
3b
)
and
the
individual
calcareous
dinocyst
species
(
Fig.
4
,
Fig.
5
,
Fig.
6
,
Fig.
7
and
Fig.
8
)
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
show
striking
differences
,
which
are
also
reflected
in
their
variable
relationships
with
(
sub
)
surface
water
environmental
parameters
(
examples
of
x
–
y
plots
are
given
for
two
representative
species
in
Fig.
9
and
Fig.
10
,
and
the
results
for
all
species
are
summarised
in
Table
3
)
.
Most
of
the
species
show
distinct
distribution
patterns
which
are
clearly
related
to
the
environment
,
independent
of
whether
their
occurrence
is
widespread
throughout
the
Atlantic
or
restricted
to
more
regional
or
even
local
areas
within
the
complex
hydrographic
system
.
As
expected
due
to
its
higher
annual
reproduction
rates
,
T.
heimii
forms
>
90
%
of
the
total
association
in
the
southern
mid-Atlantic
Ridge
samples
and
in
many
of
the
samples
off
southern
Africa
(
Fig.
3b
)
.
The
ratio
of
cysts
to
T.
heimii
is
,
on
average
,
1:20
in
the
southern
mid-Atlantic
Ridge
samples
and
1:7
off
southern
Africa
,
whereas
it
is
only
1:2
in
the
western
equatorial
Atlantic
and
1:0.5
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
.
Nevertheless
,
T.
heimii
shows
tolerance
to
a
very
broad
range
of
environmental
parameters
,
as
summarised
in
Table
3
.
It
is
common
in
neritic
,
outer
neritic
and
oceanic
areas
,
and
the
highest
relative
abundances
are
found
in
regions
where
temperatures
range
from
14
°
C
to
26
°
C
,
salinities
from
34
to
37.5
p.s.u.
,
and
densities
from
23.5
to
26.5
mg
cm
−
3
(
all
values
represent
the
0
–
75
m
water
depth
range
)
.
Subsurface
waters
are
generally
mixed
to
slightly
stratified
,
and
the
species
occurs
within
a
wide
range
of
nutrient
conditions
,
from
oligotrophic
to
eutrophic
.
As
such
,
T.
heimii
appears
to
be
a
genuinely
widespread
species
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
.
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
and
Calciodinellum
levantinum
are
by
far
the
most
common
and
widely
distributed
cyst
species
(
Fig.
4
and
Fig.
5
,
respectively
)
.
P.
tuberosa
may
form
up
to
75
%
of
the
association
in
nutrient-poor
regions
such
as
those
offshore
eastern
South
America
or
in
the
subtropical
gyres
(
Fig.
4a
)
.
Its
greatest
relative
abundances
are
found
in
regions
with
water
depths
between
3000
and
4000
m
,
and
where
temperatures
in
the
upper
75
m
of
the
water
column
range
from
18.5
to
28
°
C
,
salinities
from
36
to
37
p.s.u.
and
densities
from
24
to
26
mg
cm
−
3
(
Fig.
9
;
Table
3
)
.
The
upper
water
column
is
generally
mixed
rather
than
stratified
.
It
is
striking
that
this
species
generally
dominates
the
cyst
association
in
regions
where
oligotrophic
conditions
predominate
throughout
the
entire
water
column
(
i.e.
at
0
and
75
m
water
depth
)
.
The
distribution
of
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
,
on
the
other
hand
,
shows
a
clear
relationship
with
warm
surface
waters
(
Fig.
4b
)
.
For
example
,
relative
abundances
are
high
in
the
equatorial
Atlantic
and
in
the
southward
flowing
BC
,
which
transports
warm
waters
from
the
tropics
to
the
south
until
they
meet
up
with
the
cold
FC
at
∼
35
°
S.
Abundances
are
abruptly
reduced
to
very
low
values
or
even
to
absence
in
the
FC
and
in
the
cooler
South
Atlantic
Subtropical
Gyre
.
This
species
is
common
in
neritic
,
outer
neritic
and
oceanic
areas
,
but
occurs
in
highest
relative
abundances
in
regions
where
temperatures
in
the
upper
75
m
of
the
water
column
range
from
17
to
28
°
C
(
25
–
28
°
C
in
surface
waters
)
,
salinities
from
34
to
36.5
p.s.u.
and
densities
from
22
to
26.5
mg
cm
−
3
(
22
–
24
mg
cm
−
3
in
surface
waters
)
(
Fig.
10
;
Table
3
)
.
These
are
regions
where
seasonality
in
SST
is
low
,
and
where
subsurface
waters
are
relatively
stratified
and
nutrient-poor
.
Paratabulated
C.
albatrosianum
,
although
it
occurs
only
rarely
,
shows
a
very
similar
distribution
to
C.
albatrosianum
(
Fig.
5a
)
with
comparable
relationships
to
(
sub
)
surface
water
parameters
(
Table
3
)
.
Calciodinellum
levantinum
occurs
in
high
relative
abundances
throughout
many
different
temperature
,
salinity
and
nutrient
regimes
of
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
(
Fig.
5b
)
.
Generally
,
the
greatest
abundances
correspond
with
regions
where
temperatures
are
relatively
low
and/or
nutrient
concentrations
relatively
high
,
but
a
clear
relationship
with
(
sub
)
surface
water
conditions
or
currents
can
not
be
observed
.
It
is
common
in
outer
neritic
and
oceanic
areas
,
and
highest
relative
abundances
are
found
in
regions
where
temperatures
range
from
13
to
20
°
C
,
salinities
from
34
to
36
p.s.u.
and
densities
from
24
to
27
mg
cm
−
3
(
26
–
27
mg
cm
−
3
at
75
m
water
depth
)
(
Table
3
)
.
Subsurface
waters
are
mixed
and
generally
mesotrophic
to
eutrophic
.
Leonella
granifera
is
a
species
which
strongly
dominates
the
cyst
association
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
but
also
reaches
high
relative
abundances
in
the
more
shelfward
regions
(
i.e.
relatively
close
to
the
continental
land
masses
)
where
river
influence
may
play
an
important
role
(
see
e.g.
the
higher
abundances
in
the
vicinities
of
the
Niger
,
Congo
,
Amazon
and
Orinoco
Rivers
,
as
well
as
along
the
coast
of
eastern
South
America
where
river
input
is
substantial
;
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
6
)
.
The
regions
of
highest
relative
abundances
are
characterised
by
water
depths
between
1200
and
3000
m
,
a
temperature
range
of
16.5
to
28
°
C
,
a
salinity
range
of
27
to
36
p.s.u.
and
a
density
range
of
18
to
27
mg
cm
−
3
when
the
water
column
between
0
and
75
m
is
observed
(
Table
3
)
.
However
,
when
only
surface
water
conditions
are
taken
into
account
,
highest
abundances
occur
at
high
temperatures
(
25
–
28
°
C
)
,
low
salinities
(
27
–
34
p.s.u.
)
and
low
densities
(
18
–
23
mg
cm
−
3
)
,
in
accordance
with
the
effects
of
river
input
.
As
such
,
subsurface
conditions
are
also
stratified
and
nutrient-poor
.
However
,
a
strong
relationship
between
high
relative
abundances
of
L.
granifera
and
nutrient-rich
conditions
at
75
m
water
depth
is
observed
due
to
the
dominance
of
this
species
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
where
surface
waters
are
oligotrophic
but
the
shallow
thermocline
leads
to
the
presence
of
nutrient-rich
waters
of
Central
Water
origin
at
75
m
water
depth
.
The
remaining
species
occur
in
lower
relative
abundances
in
the
cyst
associations
,
but
can
nevertheless
be
unequivocally
related
to
particular
environmental
conditions
.
Scrippsiella
regalis
is
a
species
which
is
found
in
the
greatest
abundance
in
the
oceanic
samples
of
the
South
and
North
Atlantic
Subtropical
Gyres
,
where
(
sub
)
surface
waters
are
relatively
cool
and
oligotrophic
(
Fig.
6b
)
.
The
highest
relative
abundances
are
found
between
2800
and
4200
m
water
depth
,
within
a
temperature
range
of
14
to
21
°
C
,
a
salinity
range
of
34.5
to
36
p.s.u.
and
a
density
range
of
24.5
to
26.5
mg
cm
−
3
in
the
upper
75
m
of
the
water
column
(
Table
3
)
.
These
are
also
regions
where
seasonality
in
SST
is
relatively
high
,
and
where
subsurface
waters
are
mixed
and
nutrient-poor
,
at
least
at
the
surface
.
In
contrast
,
the
remaining
spiny
cyst
morphotypes
,
which
have
been
grouped
into
the
taxon
Rhabdothorax
sp
.
and
most
likely
represent
a
Scrippsiella
trochoidea
-
like
complex
(
see
Appendix
B
)
,
are
distributed
in
the
more
shelfward
,
nutrient-rich
areas
(
Fig.
7a
)
.
Although
I
am
aware
that
various
species
,
perhaps
with
totally
different
environmental
affinities
,
may
be
bundled
in
this
taxon
,
highest
relative
abundances
do
occur
within
restricted
areas
where
temperatures
range
from
12
to
19
°
C
,
salinities
from
34
to
36
p.s.u.
and
densities
from
25
to
27
mg
cm
−
3
(
Table
3
)
.
These
regions
are
characterised
by
a
relatively
high
SST
seasonality
,
mixed
subsurface
waters
and
nutrient-enrichment
,
conform
with
the
conditions
of
many
of
the
upwelling
areas
in
which
they
occur
.
The
only
real
cold
water
calcareous
dinocyst
species
is
Caracomia
arctica
,
found
in
only
four
samples
underlying
the
cold
,
nutrient-rich
and
relatively
fresh
FC
(
Fig.
7b
)
.
High
relative
abundances
correspond
to
temperatures
<
∼
10
°
C
,
salinities
<
∼
35
p.s.u.
and
densities
>
∼
25
mg
cm
−
3
(
Table
3
)
.
The
seasonality
in
SST
is
relatively
high
,
subsurface
waters
are
mixed
and
nutrient
concentrations
are
very
high
throughout
the
entire
upper
water
column
.
Until
recently
Calciodinellum
elongatum
was
considered
to
be
a
morphotype
of
C.
levantinum
and
was
therefore
only
recognised
as
a
separate
species
in
a
reduced
part
of
the
sample
set
(
Fig.
8a
)
.
However
,
I
assume
that
this
has
had
no
crucial
consequences
for
the
over-representation
of
C.
levantinum
in
the
remaining
samples
,
as
C.
elongatum
is
a
rare
species
which
definitely
does
not
occur
in
high
concentrations
in
any
of
those
samples
.
Based
on
the
reduced
sample
set
,
C.
elongatum
appears
to
have
a
distribution
which
is
restricted
to
the
oligotrophic
areas
in
a
way
similar
to
that
of
Pernambugia
tuberosa
.
The
species
occurs
in
neritic
,
outer
neritic
and
oceanic
areas
,
and
the
highest
relative
abundances
are
found
in
regions
where
temperatures
range
from
22
to
27
°
C
within
the
upper
75
m
of
the
water
column
,
salinities
from
36
to
37.5
p.s.u.
,
and
densities
from
24
to
26.5
mg
cm
−
3
(
Table

)
.
Subsurface
waters
are
generally
mixed
to
slightly
stratified
,
and
nutrient-poor
conditions
predominate
throughout
the
entire
upper
water
column
.
Several
specimens
of
Melodomuncula
berlinensis
,
a
species
previously
described
from
the
upper
Pleistocene
of
Crete
by
Versteegh
(
1993
)
,
were
found
in
the
Atlantic
surface
sediments
(
Fig.

)
.
Once
again
,
its
presence
has
only
been
registered
in
a
reduced
sample
set
due
to
identification
problems
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
analysis
.
It
is
a
rare
species
and
the
present
data
do
not
provide
sufficient
information
as
to
its
possible
environmental
affinities
.

Detrended
correspondence
analysis
All
previous
statistical
analyses
which
have
been
carried
out
on
calcareous
dinocysts
have
been
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
species
show
a
linear
response
to
changing
environmental
gradients
,
i.e.
decrease
or
increase
in
abundance
linearly
along
an
increasing
environmental
gradient
such
as
temperature
(
see
the
principal
component
and
redundancy
analyses
of
Höll
et
al.
,
1998
,
Höll
et
al.
,
1999
,
Vink
et
al.
,
2000
and
Zonneveld
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
However
,
the
statistical
analysis
of
the
extended
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
data
set
of
this
study
prescribes
a
unimodal
distribution
of
the
species
,
i.e.
a
non-linear
increase
in
abundance
along
an
increasing
environmental
gradient
until
an
optimum
is
reached
,
after
which
abundance
decreases
again
.
Certainly
,
the
different
results
are
associated
with
the
fact
that
more
restricted
regions
were
analysed
so
far
,
thus
only
representing
either
the
increasing
or
the
decreasing
part
of
the
unimodal
response
curve
to
particular
environmental
gradients
.
For
this
reason
,
a
DCA
rather
than
a
principal
component
analysis
was
applied
in
this
study
.
In
the
DCA
of
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
dinocyst
data
set
,
Calciodinellum
elongatum
and
Melodomuncula
berlinensis
were
excluded
due
to
their
identification
in
only
part
of
the
sample
set
.
Furthermore
,
rare
species
were
down-weighted
.
The
first
and
second
DCA-axes
account
for
59
%
and
26
%
of
the
variation
in
the
sample/species
distribution
,
respectively
(
Fig.
11
)
.
The
species
are
plotted
far
apart
from
each
other
with
respect
to
both
axes
,
showing
that
they
have
differing
distributions
.
Samples
with
related
geographic
positions
are
grouped
together
,
thus
they
contain
a
similar
type
of
cyst
association
.
The
linear
regression
of
the
known
environmental
variables
onto
the
DCA-axes
is
shown
in
Fig.
12
.
The
temperature
variables
at
0
and
75
m
water
depth
(
T
0
and
T
75
)
,
as
well
as
the
phosphate
and
nitrate
parameters
at
each
of
these
depths
(
PO
4
-0
and
NO
3
-0
;
PO
4
-75
and
NO
3
-75
)
,
have
been
taken
as
single
parameters
due
to
the
high
degree
of
covariance
between
them
.
Stratification
(
N
)
,
sea
surface
density
(
D
0
)
,
sea
surface
salinity
(
S
0
)
and
temperature
(
T
0/75
)
appear
to
be
the
most
significant
variables
determining
the
variation
in
the
species
composition
(
they
explain
≥
20
%
of
the
variation
and
are
illustrated
in
bold
in
Fig.
12
)
.
Of
these
,
N
and
D
0
,
which
are
of
course
unequivocally
linked
to
each
other
,
appear
to
have
the
largest
control
on
the
distribution
of
all
cyst
species
along
the
first
axis
,
whereas
none
of
the
given
environmental
variables
can
appropriately
explain
the
distribution
along
the
second
axis
(
Fig.
12
)
.
A
summary
of
the
correlation
between
the
distribution
of
each
species
and
the
environmental
variables
as
determined
from
the
DCA
of
all
species
(
Fig.
11
and
Fig.
12
)
and
from
DCAs
of
reduced
groups
of
three
species
,
is
given
in
Table
4
.
A
number
of
relationships
are
apparent
.
The
relative
abundances
of
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
and
paratabulated
C.
albatrosianum
correlate
positively
to
T
0/75
.
This
implies
that
the
highest
abundances
are
found
mainly
in
areas
where
(
sub
)
surface
water
temperatures
are
relatively
high
.
Additionally
,
the
paratabulated
form
shows
a
negative
correlation
with
PO
4
/
NO
3
-0
.
All
other
available
environmental
parameters
appear
to
have
an
insignificant
effect
on
their
distributions
.
Relative
abundances
of
Scrippsiella
regalis
only
correlate
negatively
to
D
75
and
PO
4
/
NO
3
-0
,
implying
greatest
abundance
in
regions
where
subsurface
densities
and
surface
water
nutrient
concentrations
are
relatively
low
.
The
remaining
species
show
a
significant
correlation
with
more
parameters
than
the
three
species
mentioned
above
.
Relative
abundances
of
Pernambugia
tuberosa
correlate
positively
with
S
0
and
S
75
,
and
negatively
with
sd
T
0
,
N
,
PO
4
/
NO
3
-0
and
PO
4
/
NO
3
-75
,
indicating
high
abundance
in
regions
where
salinities
are
relatively
high
,
seasonality
in
SST
is
low
,
and
where
subsurface
waters
are
mixed
and
nutrient-poor
.
Temperature
,
therefore
,
does
not
appear
to
significantly
influence
the
distribution
of
either
S.
regalis
or
P.
tuberosa
.
The
relative
abundance
of
Leonella
granifera
shows
a
significant
correlation
with
a
whole
suite
of
parameters
.
It
correlates
positively
with
T
0/75
,
sd
T
0
,
N
and
PO
4
/
NO
3
-75
,
but
negatively
with
wd
,
S
0
,
D
0
and
PO
4
/
NO
3
-0
.
This
implies
that
high
abundances
are
found
in
more
shelfward
areas
where
temperatures
and
SST
seasonality
are
relatively
high
,
surface
water
salinities
and
densities
are
relatively
low
,
subsurface
waters
are
stratified
and
nutrient
concentrations
are
low
at
the
surface
but
high
at
75
m
water
depth
.
The
relative
abundances
of
Calciodinellum
levantinum
and
Rhabdothorax
sp
.
correlate
significantly
with
the
same
environmental
parameters
,
namely
positively
with
D
75
and
PO
4
/
NO
3
-0
,
and
negatively
with
T
0/75
.
These
species
thus
occur
in
high
abundances
in
those
regions
where
temperatures
are
relatively
low
,
density
at
75
m
water
depth
is
high
and
surface
waters
are
nutrient-rich
.
Abundances
of
Rhabdothorax
sp
.
additionally
correlate
positively
with
sd
T
0
and
PO
4
/
NO
3
-75
.
Last
but
not
least
,
the
relative
abundance
of
Caracomia
arctica
correlates
significantly
to
all
environmental
parameters
,
probably
because
it
shows
such
a
restricted
distribution
in
a
region
where
values
of
the
parameters
are
either
extremely
high
(
e.g.
nutrient
concentration
)
or
extremely
low
(
e.g.
temperature
)
.

Discussion
5.1

Possible
effects
of
transport
and
dissolution
on
cyst
distributions
Very
little
is
known
of
the
vertical
and
lateral
transport
of
calcareous
dinocysts
through
the
water
column
from
surface
waters
to
bottom
sediments
,
where
they
may
be
preserved
.
The
results
of
sinking
experiments
carried
out
on
Scrippsiella
trochoidea
show
that
cysts
,
with
and
without
spines
,
only
settle
at
velocities
of
0.013
and
0.008
cm
s
−
1
at
22
°
C
,
respectively
;
the
rate
increasing
slightly
at
higher
temperatures
(
Anderson
et
al.
,
1985
)
.
At
this
sinking
rate
,
cysts
would
require
almost
a
year
to
reach
the
bottom
of
a
4000-m-deep
ocean
.
However
,
the
results
of
sediment
trap
analysis
off
Cape
Blanc
(
NW
Africa
)
show
that
calcareous
cysts
of
all
species
present
in
that
region
take
approximately
three
weeks
to
settle
through
the
water
column
from
a
depth
of
730
to
3557
m
(
A.
Vink
,
manuscript
in
prep
.
)
.
This
suggests
a
much
higher
sinking
velocity
of
∼
1.62
cm
s
−
1
.
I
thus
assume
that
many
of
the
cysts
are
transported
relatively
rapidly
through
the
water
column
,
most
likely
in
faecal
pellet
form
or
through
agglomeration
in
structureless
organic
matter
or
‘
marine
snow
’
(
e.g.
Honjo
,
1976
,
Lampitt
et
al.
,
1993
and
Mudie
,
1996
)
.
Nevertheless
,
calcareous
dinocysts
could
potentially
be
dispersed
over
extremely
long
distances
beyond
their
normal
geographic
limits
by
both
surface
and
deep
water
currents
.
For
example
,
Dale
and
Dale
(
1992
)
found
specimens
of
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
in
sediment
traps
deployed
in
the
Nordic
Seas
and
attributed
its
occurrence
to
transport
from
the
North
Atlantic
,
as
its
distribution
followed
the
warm
Norwegian
Atlantic
Current
in
diminishing
amounts
northwards
.
The
distribution
pattern
of
C.
albatrosianum
in
the
current
study
,
being
primarily
linked
to
warm
(
sub
)
surface
waters
,
lends
support
to
the
lateral
transport
theory
of
Dale
and
Dale
(
1992
)
.
In
the
sediment
traps
off
Cape
Blanc
(
A.
Vink
,
manuscript
in
prep
.
)
,
the
fluctuating
patterns
of
cyst
accumulation
of
the
most
common
species
in
the
upper
(
730
m
)
and
lower
(
3557
m
)
trap
are
very
similar
when
the
time
required
for
sinking
is
corrected
for
.
Interestingly
though
,
cyst
accumulation
rates
in
the
bottom
trap
are
two
to
four
times
as
high
as
those
in
the
upper
trap
,
depending
on
the
species
.
This
discrepancy
shows
that
lateral
transport
of
cysts
from
more
shelfward
areas
,
along
the
shelf
and
continental
slope
,
did
occur
.
Nevertheless
,
the
relative
abundances
of
the
species
(
in
percentage
occurrence
)
are
strikingly
similar
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
trap
.
In
contrast
to
the
Cape
Blanc
site
,
sediment
traps
from
open
oceanic
tropical
Atlantic
and
Pacific
sites
do
show
a
steady
supply
of
calcareous
dinocysts
from
the
phytoplankton
into
the
bottom
sediments
(
Dale
,
1992a
and
Dale
,
1992b
)
,
indicating
that
the
calcareous
dinocysts
in
oceanic
sediments
may
be
considered
as
being
largely
autochtonous
rather
than
the
result
of
transport
from
more
coastal
areas
.
Wall
and
Dale
(
1968
)
found
many
different
calcareous
morphotypes
in
neritic
core
material
from
the
Caribbean
Yucatan
Basin
,
including
a
bicarinate-type
,
a
keeled-type
(
=
Calcicarpinum
bivalvum
Versteegh
,
1993
)
and
a
wedged-type
(
=
Calcicarpinum
perfectum
Versteegh
,
1993
)
.
The
fact
that
these
morphotypes
were
found
in
sediments
dating
from
Pleistocene
rather
than
Holocene
or
modern
times
,
may
explain
why
these
forms
were
not
found
in
the
surface
sediments
of
the
equatorial
Atlantic
and
eastern
Caribbean
Sea
,
or
indeed
in
any
of
the
other
South
Atlantic
samples
of
this
study
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
ecologies
of
these
species
may
be
such
that
they
are
entirely
restricted
to
neritic
areas
,
thus
not
occurring
in
the
dominantly
oceanic
samples
of
this
study
.
Whatever
the
case
,
the
sample
contents
of
this
study
show
that
both
reworking
and
offshore
transport
of
neritic
cysts
have
probably
been
kept
to
a
minimum
in
most
areas
analysed
,
although
it
is
still
unclear
whether
these
cysts
would
survive
any
form
of
transport
and
remain
intact
.
Additional
alterations
to
an
original
cyst
assemblage
may
arise
at
the
sediment
–
water
interface
due
to
slumping
and
lateral
transport
through
turbidites
,
lateral
advection
of
resuspended
sediment
as
a
result
of
winnowing
by
bottom
water
currents
,
or
processes
associated
with
benthic
bioturbation
.
Although
transport
processes
are
obviously
extremely
difficult
to
quantify
,
one
of
the
most
valid
arguments
against
lateral
transport
in
this
study
is
probably
the
fact
that
many
of
the
species
distributions
in
surface
sediments
clearly
reflect
the
overlying
surface
water
hydrography
,
without
large-scale
geographic
displacement
between
the
two
patterns
.
Dissolution
of
calcareous
dinocysts
can
occur
:
(
1
)
in
sediments
located
below
the
calcite
lysocline
,
due
to
deep
water
undersaturation
with
respect
to
[
CO
3
2
-
]
;
and/or
(
2
)
through
the
bacterial
degradation
of
organic
matter
and
metabolic
CO
2
production
,
which
lowers
the
pore
water
pH
in
the
sediments
below
highly
productive
areas
(
e.g.
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002c
)
.
Vink
et
al.
(
2000
)
found
relatively
high
concentrations
of
calcareous
dinocysts
in
many
samples
located
below
the
calcite
lysocline
in
the
western
equatorial
Atlantic
,
and
suggested
that
calcareous
cysts
are
therefore
quite
resistant
to
depth-related
dissolution
.
Hints
at
selective
dissolution
of
species
were
,
however
,
given
by
the
differential
change
in
abundance
of
selected
species
over
a
depth
transect
intersecting
the
lysocline
,
in
which
Thoracosphaera
heimii
concentrations
dropped
180
times
,
Pernambugia
tuberosa
44
times
,
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
8.5
times
,
and
Calciodinellum
levantinum
4
times
.
These
discrepancies
could
not
be
attributed
to
variable
production
in
the
upper
water
column
or
variable
sedimentation
rates
,
and
were
thus
associated
with
dissolution
.
Carbonate
dissolution
due
to
organic
matter
oxidation
undoubtedly
has
a
similar
,
if
not
greater
,
effect
on
cyst
distributions
,
especially
in
areas
of
high
surface
water
productivity
.
However
,
a
clear
relationship
between
productivity-related
,
organic
matter
decay
and
cyst
dissolution
has
so
far
only
been
documented
through
the
analysis
of
a
sediment
sample
transect
encompassing
the
intensive
oxygen
minimum
zone
(
OMZ
)
in
the
NE
Arabian
Sea
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002c
)
,
whereas
no
relationship
could
be
found
in
relation
to
OMZs
in
the
SW
Arabian
Sea
or
in
the
eastern
Mediterranean
S1
sapropel
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002c
and
Zonneveld
et
al.
,
2001
,
respectively
)
.
This
is
most
likely
due
to
the
different
nature
of
the
high
productivity
regimes
.
In
the
NE
Arabian
Sea
,
samples
located
within
and
outside
the
OMZ
were
subjected
to
a
similarly
high
organic
matter
flux
,
but
increased
bioturbation
,
longer
oxygen
exposure
times
and
probably
H
2
S
oxidation
lead
to
selective
cyst
dissolution
outside
the
OMZ
.
T.
heimii
and
C.
levantinum
suffered
the
largest
loss
in
abundance
in
comparison
to
the
OMZ
(
over
80
%
)
,
whereas
smaller
losses
were
observed
for
C.
albatrosianum
and
Leonella
granifera
(
72
%
and
50
%
,
respectively
)
.
In
contrast
,
samples
located
outside
the
OMZ
in
the
SW
Arabian
Sea
were
subjected
to
lower
organic
matter
fluxes
as
they
were
situated
beyond
the
region
of
active
coastal
upwelling
,
so
that
the
cyst
abundances
primarily
reflect
horizontal
differences
in
production
rather
than
preservation
.
A
similar
scenario
,
though
temporal
rather
than
spatial
,
would
account
for
the
insignificant
cyst
abundance
changes
over
the
S1
sapropel
.
Considering
that
:
(

)
productivity
in
the
NE
Arabian
Sea
is
several
factors
higher
than
that
of
the
highest
productivity
areas
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
,
such
as
the
Benguela
upwelling
area
(
determined
from
satellite
data
and
NO
3
and
PO
4
data
from
the
Levitus
Atlas
)
,
and
(
2
)
the
high
productivity
regimes
of
the
Atlantic
are
more
comparable
to
the
SW
Arabian
Sea
(
i.e.
seasonal
upwelling
)
than
they
are
to
the
NE
Arabian
Sea
(
i.e.
deep
water
mixing
)
,
I
assume
that
cyst
losses
through
dissolution
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
were
most
likely
not
as
prominent
as
those
in
the
NE
Arabian
Sea
,
as
long
as
samples
lie
above
the
depth
of
the
calcite
lysocline
.
I
am
hopeful
that
dissolution
experiments
,
which
are
presently
being
carried
out
at
the
Alfred
Wegener
Institute
(
K.A.F.

,
will
give
more
insight
into
species-selective
dissolution
vulnerability

Influence
of
nutrients
and
stratification
on
calcareous
dinocyst
production
One
of
the
first
solid
statements
on
modern
and
Quaternary
calcareous
dinocyst
ecology
was
that
enhanced
Thoracosphaera
heimii
and
cyst
production
could
be
correlated
to
periods
and/or
regions
of
reduced
productivity
,
probably
related
to
relatively
stratified
conditions
of
the
upper
water
column
(
Höll
et
al.
,
1998
,
Höll
et
al.
,
1999
,
Vink
et
al.
,
2000
and
Esper
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
Consequent
analysis
of
a
multi-proxy
core
from
the
Ceará
Rise
offshore
northern
Brazil
,
which
is
rather
unusual
in
that
periods
of
greatest
oligotrophy
are
not
synchronous
with
periods
of
greatest
stratification
,
showed
that
stratification
of
the
upper
water
column
and
the
presence
of
a
well-developed
thermocline
are
probably
more
important
than
oligotrophy
in
controlling
general
T.
heimii
and
cyst
distribution
in
the
oceanic
sector
of
the
equatorial
Atlantic
(
Vink
et
al.
,
2002
)
.
The
suggestion
was
made
that
a
stratified
upper
water
column
and
a
well-established
thermo
-
/
pycnocline
may
be
essential
in
forming
so-called
‘
buffer
layers
’
where
the
immobile
calcareous
cysts
and
shells
of
T.
heimii
can
be
collected
before
excystment
allows
the
motile
dinoflagellates
to
return
directly
to
the
photic
zone
.
The
field
observations
made
by
Karwath
(
2000
)
,
showing
that
the
depth
of
maximum
occurrence
of
full
shells
of
T.
heimii
in
the
equatorial
Atlantic
is
connected
with
the
position
of
the
uppermost
part
of
the
thermocline
(
50
–
100
m
)
,
lends
support
to
this
theory
.
Apart
from
preventing
further
sinking
of
cysts
and
shells
to
depths
well
below
the
photic
zone
,
which
would
greatly
hamper
the
chances
of
survival
after
excystment
,
the
collection
of
cysts
and
shells
at
the
thermo
-
/
pycnocline
allows
the
removal
of
cells
from
the
relatively
higher
levels
of
predation
in
the
biologically
more
active
euphotic
zone
(
Dale
,
1992b
)
,
and
cells
can
additionally
gain
access
to
the
nutritionally
richer
waters
of
the
Deep
Chlorophyll
Maximum
(
DCM
)
.
The
type
of
open
ocean
stratification
referred
to
above
should
not
be
confused
with
the
density
stratification
produced
by
Amazon
or
Niger
River
discharge
,
which
,
perhaps
with
the
exception
of
Leonella
granifera
,
does
not
favour
high
T.
heimii
and
cyst
production
.
This
is
most
likely
due
to
the
low
salinity
and/or
extremely
high
phytoplankton
production
which
is
associated
with
such
a
form
of
stratification
.
In
surface
sediment
and
sediment
trap
analysis
off
Somalia
,
a
negative
relationship
between
primary
productivity
and
T.
heimii
/
dinocyst
accumulation
could
not
be
confirmed
,
whereas
strong
turbulence
and
high
current
speeds
in
the
areas
of
active
upwelling
were
unfavourable
for
their
production
and
accumulation
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
and
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002b
)
.
These
authors
concluded
that
lower
T.
heimii
and
cyst
production
rates
under
the
turbulent
conditions
of
coastal
upwelling
occur
as
turbulence
precludes
the
build-up
of
a
standing
stock
of
phototrophic
organisms
.
Laboratory
studies
carried
out
on
various
calcareous
dinocyst
species
have
also
shown
that
cyst
production
is
considerably
higher
under
non-agitated
conditions
than
under
mixed
conditions
(
C.
Höll
,
pers
.
commun
.
2001
)
.
Wendler
et
al.
(
2002b
)
generally
discard
the
oligotrophy
theory
and
conclude
from
their
sediment
trap
study
off
Somalia
that
‘
cyst
production
is
favoured
under
conditions
of
mature
upwelled
water
,
which
is
characterised
by
relatively
high
nutrient
concentrations
and
reduced
turbulence
’
.
However
,
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
higher
cyst
production
during
nutrient-rich
conditions
is
essentially
based
on
the
reaction
of
three
species
only
,
i.e.
Thoracosphaera
heimii
,
Leonella
granifera
and
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
.
Species
which
definitely
show
preferences
for
oligotrophic
areas
,
such
as
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
were
hardly
found
in
their
studied
area
.
Flux
rates
calculated
from
four
oceanic
sediment
trap
locations
in
the
western
subtropical
North
Atlantic
and
Pacific
also
showed
that
fluxes
of
what
Dale
(
1992b
)
called
‘
thoracosphaerids
’
(
T.
heimii
+
L.
granifera
)
were
the
highest
at
the
location
with
the
most
productive
surface
waters
,
whereas
the
flux
rates
of
all
remaining
calcareous
cyst
species
were
higher
in
the
more
oligotrophic
areas
(
Dale
,
1992a
and
Dale
,
1992b
)
.
In
addition
,
fluxes
of
L.
granifera
and
C.
albatrosianum
in
the
sediment
traps
offshore
Cape
Blanc
are
on
average
at
least
twice
as
high
as
those
off
Somalia
,
even
though
productivity
is
lower
there
(
A.
Vink
,
manuscript
in
prep
.
)
.
Obviously
,
other
environmental
factors
may
be
of
equal
significance
in
controlling
species
distributions
,
and
the
complex
interplay
between
environment
and
biological
–
ecological
factors
such
as
interspecific/intraspecific
competition
or
grazing
rates
makes
it
very
difficult
to
pinpoint
exact
ecological
traits
of
species
.
The
partly
conflicting
oligotrophy
vs.
eutrophy
theories
emphasise
how
dangerous
it
is
to
generalise
the
quite
variable
ecological
preferences
of
different
species
into
the
one
term
‘
calcareous
dinocyst
ecology
’
,
and
I
would
strongly
urge
authors
to
focus
more
on
the
ecologies
of
individual
species
rather
than
bundling
them
in
future
analyses
.

Ecological
information
at
the
species
level
:
relationships
between
distribution
and
environment
5.3.1
.
Thoracosphaera
heimii
This
species
strongly
dominates
over
the
calcareous
dinocyst
associations
in
most
oceanographic
regions
,
due
to
its
ability
to
produce
large
numbers
of
shells
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
.
It
has
a
geographically
widespread
distribution
and
is
assumed
to
have
a
very
broad
range
of
ecological
tolerance
(
Fig.
3b
;
Table
3
)
.
Highest
percentage
abundances
of
Thoracosphaera
heimii
occur
in
the
somewhat
cooler
regions
of
the
South
Atlantic
(
i.e.
in
the
South
Atlantic
Gyre
and
the
Benguela
upwelling
region
)
,
where
they
often
form
more
than
95
%
of
the
total
assemblage
.
In
contrast
,
relative
abundances
are
lower
in
all
equatorial
surface
sediments
,
presumably
due
to
non-linear
combinations
of
:
(
1
)
lower
T.
heimii
production
,
perhaps
linked
to
the
high
SSTs
which
appear
to
fluctuate
within
the
upper
limit
of
its
temperature
tolerance
range
(
Table
3
)
,
and
(
2
)
higher
abundances
of
the
calcareous
dinocyst
species
in
these
areas
.
The
preferred
temperature
range
of
14
to
26
°
C
found
in
this
study
and
the
fact
that
Thoracosphaera
heimii
appears
to
thrive
well
under
eutrophic
conditions
supports
the
results
obtained
from
culturing
experiments
and
field
observations
so
far
.
Growth
experiments
carried
out
on
T.
heimii
cultures
at
different
temperature
and
nutrient
levels
showed
that
this
species
grows
steadily
between
14
and
27
°
C
(
Karwath
et
al.
,
2000b
)
.
Its
growth
rates
increased
with
nutrient
supply
.
Additionally
,
it
did
not
show
an
expected
unimodal
response
curve
vs.
temperature
,
the
values
simply
rising
with
increasing
temperature
towards
maximal
growth
rates
around
27
°
C.
However
,
the
final
yield
after
80
days
of
culturing
showed
an
opposite
trend
and
decreased
with
increasing
temperature
,
suggesting
that
under
identical
nutritional
conditions
and
over
a
longer
period
of
time
,
the
greatest
numbers
of
cysts
were
produced
at
lower
temperatures
around
16
°
C
.
In
addition
,
calcification
of
T.
heimii
shells
was
found
to
be
inversely
related
to
temperature
,
probably
because
the
relatively
low
growth
rates
at
lower
temperatures
allow
a
better
calcification
.
In
field
observations
,
maximum
occurrences
of
T.
heimii
shells
with
cell
content
were
observed
in
subsurface-waters
between
18
and
26.8
°
C
,
at
depths
between
50
and
100
m
(
i.e.
around
the
thermo
-
/
pycnocline
)
and
where
nutrients
in
the
DCM
were
easily
accessible
and
competition
with
other
phytoplankton
was
less
due
to
the
greatly
reduced
light
intensities
(
Karwath
et
al.
,
2000a
)
.
Where
seasonally
comparable
data
were
available
,
higher
abundances
were
always
attained
in
the
cooler
and/or
more
nutrient-rich
of
the
two
studied
seasons
.
High
Thoracosphaera
heimii
production
thus
appears
to
occur
under
conditions
of
relatively
low
(
sub
)
surface
water
temperature
and
high
nutrient
availability
.
Where
a
well-developed
and
relatively
shallow
thermo
-
/
pycnocline
is
present
(
e.g.
in
the
equatorial
Atlantic
)
,
the
nutrients
are
obtained
from
the
DCM
.
However
,
the
presence
of
a
thermocline
does
not
appear
to
be
essential
,
as
relatively
high
concentrations
of
T.
heimii
are
also
found
in
the
Benguela
upwelling
region
and
they
are
especially
successful
in
the
Arabian
Sea
upwelling
areas
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
and
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002b
)
.
5.3.2
.
Pernambugia
tuberosa
The
most
striking
factor
apparently
influencing
the
distribution
of
Pernambugia
tuberosa
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
is
oligotrophy
throughout
the
entire
water
column
,
as
shown
by
its
very
strong
negative
correlation
with
phosphate
and
nitrate
parameters
at
both
0
and
75
m
water
depth
(
Table
4
)
and
its
restricted
distribution
pattern
in
nutrient-poor
regions
such
as
the
mid-Atlantic
Gyres
or
along
the
coast
of
eastern
Brazil
(
i.e.
independent
of
sample
depth
;
see
Fig.
4a
)
.
In
this
respect
,
the
clear
breaks
in
its
distribution
from
the
oligotrophic
South
Atlantic
Gyre
(
i.e.
the
southern
branch
of
the
SEC
)
,
over
the
nutrient-rich
NECC
into
the
oligotrophic
North
Atlantic
Gyre
(
i.e.
the
NEC
)
show
the
potential
of
this
species
to
reflect
hydrographic
fronts
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
.
This
species
apparently
prefers
relatively
saline
(
36
–
37
p.s.u.
)
,
mixed
subsurface
water
conditions
in
a
relatively
stable
and
predictable
environment
affected
by
minimal
seasonality
(
Table
4
)
.
Due
to
its
absence
from
other
areas
analysed
for
calcareous
dinoflagellate
cysts
so
far
,
i.e.
the
Arabian
Sea
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
)
and
Mediterranean
Sea
(
Meier
and
Willems
,
2003
)
,
only
little
was
known
previously
about
its
ecology
.
5.3.3
.
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
The
distribution
of
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
shows
a
clear
relationship
with
warm
(
sub
)
surface
waters
(
Fig.
4
and
Fig.
10
)
,
with
highest
abundances
occurring
in
surface
waters
between
25
and
28
°
C
,
and
subsurface
waters
between
17
and
26.5
°
C.
Although
the
distribution
pattern
reflects
a
general
preference
of
this
species
for
regions
with
relatively
stratified
and
nutrient-poor
surface
waters
,
the
statistical
analyses
suggest
that
all
parameters
other
than
temperature
have
an
insignificant
effect
on
its
distribution
(
Table
4
)
.
A
striking
relationship
with
relatively
high
SST
was
also
shown
by
the
C.
albatrosianum
distribution
in
five
late
Quaternary
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
cores
(
Esper
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
As
such
,
C.
albatrosianum
would
be
a
good
potential
candidate
for
the
development
of
a
cyst-based
transfer
function
in
order
to
quantitatively
predict
past
fluctuations
in
(
sub
)
surface
water
temperature
.
In
the
analysis
of
10
surface
water
samples
from
the
equatorial
Atlantic
,
Janofske
and
Karwath
(
2000
)
reported
that
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
cysts
with
cell
content
were
present
throughout
the
water
column
down
to
175
m
water
depth
within
a
temperature
range
from
13
to
29
°
C
,
but
that
the
highest
concentrations
were
found
in
depths
of
75
,
100
and
175
m
in
the
western
Atlantic
and
from
10
to
50
m
in
the
eastern
Atlantic
.
This
distribution
likely
reflects
the
depth
of
the
thermocline
,
which
deepens
drastically
from
the
east
to
the
west
in
the
equatorial
Atlantic
oceanic
sector
.
As
such
,
C.
albatrosianum
may
be
a
thermocline-dwelling
species
in
much
the
same
way
as
Thoracosphaera
heimii
or
indeed
the
coccolithophorid
species
Florisphaera
profunda
,
which
has
often
been
described
as
a
typical
thermocline-dwelling
species
in
nutrient-poor
areas
(
e.g.
Molfino
and
McIntyre
,
1990
and
Beaufort
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
In
a
statistical
analysis
of
different
plankton
groups
in
the
South
Atlantic
,
Vink
et
al.
(
2003
)
found
that
C.
albatrosianum
and
F.
profunda
plotted
very
close
to
each
other
,
also
implying
similar
environmental
preferences
.
In
the
Arabian
Sea
,
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
was
generally
found
in
the
warmer
regions
of
the
sea
,
in
low
concentrations
in
the
eutrophic
upwelling
areas
as
well
as
in
higher
concentrations
in
the
oligotrophic
open
ocean
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
)
.
These
results
,
and
those
of
the
present
study
in
which
cysts
are
also
still
found
in
low
concentrations
in
the
equatorial
and
Benguela
upwelling
areas
,
suggest
that
C.
albatrosianum
can
adapt
to
a
wide
range
of
nutrient
levels
within
a
generally
warm
(
sub
)
surface
water
environment
.
In
addition
,
this
species
is
generally
found
in
high
abundances
in
those
regions
where
the
seasonality
in
SST
is
low
(
Table
3
)
.
Thus
,
the
generally
low
background
abundances
of
C.
albatrosianum
found
in
surface
sediments
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
(
they
never
form
more
than
5
%
of
the
assemblage
;
Meier
and
Willems
,
2003
)
could
well
be
attributed
to
seasonally
low
water
temperatures
in
this
area
.
5.3.4
.
Paratabulated
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
Paratabulated
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
,
although
it
occurs
only
rarely
,
shows
a
very
similar
distribution
to
C.
albatrosianum
(
Fig.
5a
)
,
with
a
preference
for
relatively
high
water
temperatures
(
26
–
28
°
C
in
surface
waters
;
23
–
26.5
°
C
at
75
m
water
depth
)
and
nutrient-poor
(
sub
)
surface
water
conditions
(
Table
3
)
.
All
other
available
environmental
parameters
appear
to
have
an
insignificant
influence
on
its
distribution
(
Table
4
)
.
This
distribution
pattern
strengthens
the
hypothesis
that
C.
albatrosianum
and
the
paratabulated
morphotype
may
be
genetically
linked
(

Appendix
B
)
,
a
phenomenon
which
is
in
fact
well
known
in
other
dinoflagellate
species
as
well
(
for
example
,
many
organic-walled
cyst
species/morphotypes
of
the
genus
Spiniferites
show
similar
morphologies
and
environmental
preferences
,
and
derive
from
the
same
dinoflagellate
species
)

Calciodinellum
levantinum
Calciodinellum
levantinum
appears
to
be
the
most
widespread
of
all
the
calcareous
cyst
species
found
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
,
occurring
in
varying
abundances
throughout
many
different
temperature
,
salinity
and
trophic
regimes
.
Nevertheless
,
the
distributions
,
statistical
analyses
and
x
–
y
graphs
do
reveal
preferences
for
relatively
cool
(
13
–
20
°
C
)
and
nutrient-rich
environments
such
as
those
of
the
Benguela
upwelling
area
(
Fig.
5b
;
Table
3
and
Table
4
)
.
However
,
the
extremely
high
relative
abundances
of
this
species
in
the
samples
of
the
Benguela
region
(
often
forming
>
75
%
of
the
calcareous
dinocyst
association
)
may
simply
show
that
it
is
more
resistant
to
dissolution
related
to
organic
matter
degradation
than
the
other
species
.
Indeed
,
in
a
depth
transect
across
the
Ceará
Rise
,
C.
levantinum
concentrations
hardly
dropped
in
the
deeper
samples
which
were
located
below
the
lysocline
(
Vink
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
However
,
Wendler
et
al.
(
2002c
)
reveal
that
this
species
is
probably
the
most
sensitive
of
all
cyst
species
to
dissolution
associated
with
remineralisation
reactions
in
the
Arabian
Sea
.
I
therefore
believe
that
at
least
a
large
part
of
the
Benguela
upwelling
signal
reflects
relatively
high
C.
levantinum
production
in
nutrient-rich
environments
.
Nevertheless
,
relatively
high
abundances
of
C.
levantinum
have
also
been
found
in
nutrient-poor
regions
such
as
in
the
western
equatorial
Atlantic
.
Here
,
a
strong
negative
relationship
with
temperature
and
positive
relationship
with
density
parameters
at
100
m
water
depth
led
to
the
suggestion
made
by
Vink
et
al.
(
2000
)
that
this
species
may
thrive
just
below
the
thermocline
.
Indeed
,
this
would
be
the
depth
of
the
DCM
in
which
the
temperatures
are
somewhat
lower
and
most
nutrients
are
available
in
such
an
otherwise
warm
,
oligotrophic
area
.
Water
sample
analysis
from
the
oligotrophic
western
North
Atlantic
Gyre
lends
support
to
this
suggestion
(
A.
Vink
,
unpubl
.
data
)
.
A
similar
depth
habitat
could
be
responsible
for
the
dominance
of
this
species
in
the
oligotrophic
western
Mediterranean
Sea
(
Meier
and
Willems
,
2003
)
.

Leonella
granifera
In
culture
,
Leonella
granifera
closely
resembles
Thoracosphaera
heimii
,
as
its
calcareous
cyst
stage
is
clearly
dominant
over
the
motile
stage
and
rapid
cycling
from
the
motile
to
the
cyst
stage
occurs
(
Janofske
and
Karwath
,
2000
)
.
This
,
together
with
its
typically
round
archaeopyle
and
frequently
small
size
,
which
is
very
similar
to
that
of
T.
heimii
,
could
be
an
indication
that
we
are
also
dealing
with
a
vegetative
coccoid
here
,
but
this
is
speculation
only
and
further
cultivation
experiments
are
required
to
prove
or
discard
this
notion
.
Despite
their
morphological
and
physiological
similarities
,
L.
granifera
and
T.
heimii
have
very
different
distribution
patterns
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
.
L.
granifera
is
a
very
interesting
species
as
it
shows
a
distinct
dominance
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
and
in
other
shelfward
regions
where
river
influence
is
substantial
(
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
6
)
.
Due
to
this
dominance
,
the
statistical
analyses
show
a
strong
correlation
between
high
species
abundance
and
high
SST
(
25
–
28
°
C
)
,
low
surface
water
salinity
(
27
–
34
p.s.u.
)
,
high
subsurface
water
stratification
and
oligotrophic
surface
water
conditions
(
Table
3
and
Table
4
)
.
Nevertheless
,
a
relationship
with
eutrophic
conditions
at
75
m
water
depth
is
also
observed
due
to
the
shallow
thermocline
(
10
–
50
m
deep
)
and
the
consequent
presence
of
nutrient-rich
Central
Water
at
75
m
water
depth
in
the
eastern
equatorial
Atlantic
.
As
we
still
do
not
know
exactly
at
which
depth
(
s
)
L.
granifera
lives
in
the
photic
zone
,
it
is
unclear
from
these
results
whether
this
species
reacts
to
the
surface
water
conditions
or
those
predominating
in
the
deeper
subsurface
layers
.
In
the
analysis
of
10
surface
water
samples
from
the
equatorial
Atlantic
,
Janofske
and
Karwath
(
2000
)
reported
that
cysts
with
cell
content
were
present
at
all
depths
down
to
150
m
,
within
a
temperature
range
of
13
to
28.7
°
C
,
but
the
highest
concentrations
were
found
between
10
and
50
m
.
These
results
,
though
sparse
,
would
favour
a
relationship
with
the
stratified
,
low
salinity
and
relatively
warm
subsurface
water
conditions
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
forced
by
Niger
and
Congo
River
input
.
However
,
a
relationship
with
oligotrophy
is
unlikely
,
as
the
generally
shallow
position
of
the
thermo
-
/
pycnocline
brings
the
DCM
and
nutrient-rich
Central
Water
high
up
into
the
photic
zone
,
thus
supplying
nutrients
to
the
phytoplankton
of
the
upper
water
column
.
Moreover
,
L.
granifera
has
been
found
in
relatively
high
concentrations
in
other
regions
which
are
characterised
by
(
sub
)
surface
water
nutrient
enrichment
,
such
as
the
Benguela
upwelling
area
and
the
nutrient-rich
zone
of
deep
water
mixing
in
the
NE
Arabian
Sea
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
)
.
Obviously
,
the
statistics
relating
to
Leonella
granifera
in
this
study
have
been
strongly
biased
by
its
high
relative
abundances
in
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
and
so
the
relationships
shown
mainly
relate
to
this
region
only
.
For
example
,
relatively
high
abundances
of
L.
granifera
in
several
samples
of
the
Benguela
upwelling
area
show
that
this
species
can
not
be
considered
as
a
purely
warm
water
species
,
in
contrast
to
what
the
statistical
analyses
may
suggest
.
Ultimately
,
only
two
important
environmental
factors
seem
to
characterise
,
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
,
all
regions
with
exceptionally
high
concentrations
of
L.
granifera
.
These
are
:
(
1
)
river
input
,
and
(
2
)
nutrient-enrichment
(
i.e.
through
upwelling
,
river
input
and/or
the
presence
of
a
relatively
shallow
nutricline
and/or
well-developed
DCM
within
the
photic
zone
)
.
In
the
Gulf
of
Guinea
,
both
Niger
and
Congo
River
output
and
the
presence
of
a
shallow
nutricline
probably
stimulate
high
L.
granifera
production
.
In
the
western
tropical
Atlantic
,
slightly
lower
but
nevertheless
strikingly
high
abundances
are
found
in
the
more
shelfward
areas
where
Amazon
and
Orinoco
River
influence
is
substantial
(
Fig.
6a
)
,
reflecting
the
input
of
riverine
nutrients
and
minerals
into
the
ocean
.
Similar
relationships
have
been
found
in
oceans
and
seas
beyond
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
.
In
the
Arabian
Sea
,
for
example
,
highest
abundances
of
L.
granifera
,
approaching
the
values
recorded
in
the
Niger
discharge
region
,
were
found
in
the
nutrient-rich
,
northeastern
sector
,
where
Indus
River
discharge
and
deep
water
mixing
bring
large
amounts
of
nutrients
into
the
photic
zone
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002a
)
.
In
addition
,
a
study
involving
the
analysis
of
calcareous
dinocysts
in
the
eastern
Mediterranean
S1
organic-rich
sapropel
(
onset
at
∼
9
kyr
BP
)
revealed
high
abundances
of
L.
granifera
,
in
comparison
to
almost
negligible
abundances
before
and
after
sapropel
formation
(
Zonneveld
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
This
temporal
distribution
pattern
is
not
the
result
of
better
preservation
in
the
sapropelic
layer
,
as
L.
granifera
is
relatively
resistant
to
dissolution
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002c
)
,
and
more
dissolution-sensitive
species
such
as
Thoracosphaera
heimii
do
not
show
a
significant
concentration
change
over
the
sapropelic
layer
.
Although
the
mechanisms
leading
to
the
formation
of
such
a
sapropel
are
still
under
discussion
(
e.g.
Rohling
and
Thunell
,
1999
)
,
it
is
generally
accepted
that
increased
primary
production
in
the
subsurface
waters
prevailed
,
perhaps
due
to
a
combination
of
:
(
1
)
greater
river
run-off
and
upper
water
column
stratification
,
and
(
2
)
a
vertical
ascent
of
the
position
of
the
pycnocline
and
nutricline
,
and
thus
the
DCM
,
into
the
photic
zone
(
e.g.
Rohling
and
Hilgen
,
1991
)
.
These
conditions
fit
well
with
those
postulated
for
optimal
L.
granifera
production
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
today
.
An
additional
possibility
may
be
that
this
species
reacts
to
low
surface
water
salinity
,
although
this
can
not
explain
the
high
relative
abundances
off
NW
Africa
(
e.g.
sample
GeoB
4303-6
)
or
SW
Africa
(
e.g.
several
Benguela
samples
)
,
where
present
salinities
do
not
fall
below
35
p.s.u.
(
Appendix
A
)
.
Also
,
in
an
analysis
of
sediment
traps
off
Cape
Blanc
,
extreme
peaks
in
L.
granifera
production
could
be
clearly
correlated
to
seasonally
high
nutrient
input
and
productivity
related
to
coastal
upwelling
,
despite
relatively
high
SSS
(
A.
Vink
,
manuscript
in
prep
.
)
.
Although
river
input
is
negligible
in
this
area
,
periods
of
high
productivity
correlate
with
intensified
NE
trade
wind
action
and
dust
input
from
the
Sahara
,
thus
also
containing
a
terrestrial
component
.
A
similar
wind-related
scenario
may
have
contributed
to
the
relatively
high
abundances
of
L.
granifera
in
the
samples
off
SW
Africa
.
Summarising
,
it
is
quite
striking
that
terrestrial
input
is
linked
in
some
way
or
another
to
every
significant
occurrence
of
L.
granifera
so
far
,
although
the
role
of
absolute
nutrient
availability
for
its
optimal
production
is
also
not
to
be
underestimated
.
I
tentatively
suggest
that
L.
granifera
requires
,
in
addition
to
the
normal
range
of
nutrients
derived
from
the
open
ocean
,
particular
land-derived
nutrients
or
minerals
for
its
optimal
production
.

Scrippsiella
regalis
Specimens
of
Scrippsiella
regalis
appear
to
be
mainly
confined
to
the
oceanic
,
cool
,
well-mixed
and
oligotrophic
sectors
of
the
equatorial
and
South
Atlantic
,
although
they
do
also
occur
in
neritic
areas
(
Fig.
6b
;
Table
3
)
.
In
a
similar
way
to
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
the
distribution
of
S.
regalis
shows
a
clear
break
from
the
oligotrophic
South
Atlantic
Gyre
,
over
the
nutrient-rich
NECC
,
into
the
oligotrophic
North
Atlantic
Gyre
(
Fig.
6b
)
.
The
spatial
and
temporal
distributions
of
both
species
can
thus
be
of
tremendous
use
in
tracing
the
lateral
shifts
of
equatorial
surface
water
currents
and
gyres
throughout
the
last
few
Glacial/Interglacial
cycles
(
e.g.
Vink
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
The
statistical
analyses
suggest
that
S.
regalis
relates
mainly
to
a
relatively
low
water
density
at
75
m
water
depth
and
to
low
surface
water
nutrient
concentrations
,
implying
that
low
(
sub
)
surface
water
temperatures
are
only
of
secondary
importance
in
determining
its
distribution
(
Table
4
)
.
Unfortunately
,
little
information
on
its
ecology
has
been
obtained
from
previous
studies
so
far
.
5.3.8

Rhabdothorax
sp
The
distribution
of
Rhabdothorax
sp.
,
which
actually
represents
a
Scrippsiella
trochoidea
-
like
complex
,
resembles
that
of
Calciodinellum
levantinum
in
many
aspects
,
although
it
shows
a
clear
discrimination
for
environments
located
not
more
than
a
few
hundred
kilometres
away
from
the
continental
land
masses
(
Fig.
7a
)
.
Although
several
different
species
or
morphotypes
may
have
been
bundled
into
this
taxon
(
see
Appendix
B
)
,
a
relatively
restricted
distribution
pattern
is
shown
.
Significant
factors
apparently
influencing
its
distribution
are
relatively
low
(
sub
)
surface
water
temperatures
(
12
–
19
°
C
)
,
a
high
seasonality
in
SST
,
high
nutrient
concentrations
throughout
the
upper
water
column
and
a
high
density
at
75
m
water
depth
(
Table
3
and
Table
4
)
.
The
main
difference
between
species
of
this
taxon
and
Scrippsiella
trochoidea
is
that
the
latter
is
known
exclusively
from
the
neritic
environment
(
e.g.
Janofske
,
2000
)
.
In
addition
,
S.
trochoidea
is
considered
euryhaline
and
cosmopolitan
in
neritic
environments
,
and
due
to
its
relatively
short
dormancy
period
,
it
has
a
high
capability
of
shifting
from
the
motile
to
the
dormant
stage
and
thus
often
shows
a
high
production
rate
almost
uninterruptedly
over
several
months
,
thereby
dominating
the
total
dinoflagellate
population
(
Montresor
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Such
high
production
rates
have
not
been
observed
for
Rhabdothorax
sp
.
in
any
of
the
analysed
samples
of
this
study
,
assuming
that
they
have
not
been
removed
by
dissolution
which
,
I
believe
,
would
have
altered
the
entire
assemblage
rather
than
removing
species
of
this
taxon
only
.
Different
types
of
spiny
cysts
were
also
found
in
the
Arabian
Sea
and
bundled
into
a
trochoidea
-
like
complex
by
Wendler
et
al.
(
2002a
)
.
Clearly
,
we
are
dealing
with
one
or
more
new
species
here
which
require
further
detailed
analysis
.
5.3.9
.
Caracomia
arctica
Caracomia
arctica
is
the
only
real
cold
water
calcareous
dinoflagellate
cyst
known
from
recent
surface
sediments
.
In
this
study
,
several
specimens
were
observed
in
each
of
four
samples
located
below
the
cold
(
≤
10
°
C
)
,
relatively
fresh
(
≤
∼
35
p.s.u.
)
,
well-mixed
and
eutrophic
FC
(
Fig.
7b
;
Table
3
and
Table
4
)
.
Its
absence
from
the
Benguela
upwelling
region
and
the
Subtropical
and
Subantarctic
Fronts
indicates
that
this
species
has
a
purely
polar
distribution
.
The
reflection
of
the
FC
by
C.
arctica
hints
at
its
potential
to
reconstruct
shifts
in
the
position
of
this
current
throughout
at
least
the
late
Quaternary
.
The
modern
distribution
pattern
of
C.
arctica
complements
the
information
presently
available
on
its
fossil
occurrences
,
which
are
unequivocally
restricted
to
the
cold
waters
of
both
hemispheres
(
Streng
et
al.
,
2002
)
.
Indeed
,
Gilbert
and
Clark
(
1983
)
even
showed
that
low
abundances
of
this
species
(
under
the
name
Thoracosphaera
arctica
)
occurred
in
the
Arctic
Ocean
during
Pliocene
and
Pleistocene
periods
characterised
by
increased
ice-rafting
and
an
assumed
ice-covered
,
turbid
photic
zone
.
5.3.10
.
Calciodinellum
elongatum
Calciodinellum
elongatum
shows
a
distribution
which
is
apparently
restricted
to
the
purely
oligotrophic
regions
of
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
is
the
case
for
Pernambugia
tuberosa
(
Fig.
8a
)
.
Relatively
high
temperatures
and
salinities
characterise
its
distribution
area
(
Table
3
)
.
In
modern
and
Quaternary
sediments
,
this
species
has
so
far
only
been
described
from
the
warm
,
extremely
saline
(
∼
39
p.s.u.
)
and
oligotrophic
eastern
Mediterranean
Sea
,
where
it
forms
a
large
part
of
the
association
together
with
the
endemic
species
Lebessphaera
urania
(
Meier
and
Willems
,
2003
)
.
The
ecological
affinities
obtained
from
their
South
Atlantic
distributions
thus
fit
those
of
the
eastern
Mediterranean
Sea
very
well
.
Strikingly
though
,
specimens
of
P.
tuberosa
were

Melodomuncula
berlinensis
Only
very
few
specimens
of
the
rare
species
Melodomuncula
berlinensis
were
found
in
the
surface
sediments
of
this
study
(
Fig.

)
,
making
it
impossible
to
determine
any
ecological
traits
with
an
acceptable
degree
of
accuracy
.
Additionally
,
its
occurrence
in
sediments
relatively
close
to
the
continental
land
masses
and
the
fact
that
it
is
so
rare
could
be
an
indication
for
reworking
rather
than
modern
production
.
However
,
several
specimens
of
this
species
have
recently
been
registered
in
surface
sediments
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
(
Meier
et

and
the

,
and
even
in
a

Palaeoenvironmental
reconstruction
potential
:
state
of
the
art
The
calcareous
dinocyst
data
set
of
this
study
is
the
largest
one
collected
so
far
and
has
provided
a
new
wealth
of
ecological
information
concerning
this
thusfar
relatively
poorly
studied
group
of
marine
dinoflagellates
.
Although
the
relationships
between
the
distributions
of
species
and
environmental
factors
tend
to
be
complex
,
non-linear
and
species-specific
,
the
results
of
this
study
show
that
at
least
several
species
react
sensitively
to
a
unique
combination
of
environmental
parameters
,
which
is
extremely
promising
for
the
future
applicability
of
calcareous
cysts
in
palaeoenvironmental
and
palaeoceanographic
reconstructions
.
One
of
the
strongest
characteristics
of
several
of
the
calcareous
dinocyst
species
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
is
their
ability
to
reflect
the
region
of
influence
of
particular
surface
water
currents
(
e.g.
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
Scrippsiella
regalis
,
Caracomia
arctica
)
.
Down-core
association
and
accumulation
changes
of
these
species
can
be
very
useful
in
tracing
the
past
spatial
variability
in
the
positions
of
such
currents
,
the
knowledge
of
which
,
in
turn
,
may
provide
important
clues
and
insights
into
the
causes
and
effects
of
ocean
and
climate
change
.
For
example
,
P.
tuberosa
and
S.
regalis
both
occur
in
relatively
high
abundances
in
the
oligotrophic
North
and
South
Atlantic
Gyres
(
i.e.
the
NEC
and
the
southern
branch
of
the
SEC
,
respectively
)
,
but
are
hardly
found
in
the
nutrient-rich
NECC
or
the
equatorial
oceanic
upwelling
region
which
geographically
separates
the
two
gyres
(
Fig.
4
and
Fig.
6
,
respectively
)
.
In
a
particularly
illustrative
case
study
of
a
high-resolution
Quaternary
core
from
the
eastern
Caribbean
Sea
,
their
restricted
distributions
in
the
NEC
proved
to
be
extremely
useful
in
the
reconstruction
of
significant
seasonal
and/or
permanent
southward
shifts
in
the
position
of
the
NEC
during
the
Last
Glacial
period
and
the
Younger
Dryas
cold
interval
(
Vink
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
These
NEC
shifts
were
solely
reflected
by
cyst
association
changes
and
were
not
reflected
by
other
proxy
parameters
,
illustrating
the
importance
of
a
multi-proxy
approach
to
most
environmental
reconstructions
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
power
of
calcareous
dinocysts
to
provide
unique
palaeoenvironmental
information
on
the
other
hand
.
Similarly
,
I
am
sure
that
down-core
changes
in
the
abundance
of
C.
arctica
will
provide
important
information
concerning
potential
variations
in
the
position
and
intensity
of
the
FC
offshore
Argentina
(
Fig.
7b
)
.
Several
calcareous
dinocyst
species
show
a
clear
preference
for
warm
(
sub
)
surface
waters
and
thus
show
potential
usefulness
as
palaeotemperature
proxies
;
these
are
Calciodinellum
albatrosianum
,
paratabulated
C.
albatrosianum
and
,
to
a
lesser
extent
,
Leonella
granifera
.
In
addition
,
these
species
tend
to
occur
mainly
in
those
regions
where
a
well-developed
thermocline
and
a
distinct
subsurface
water
temperature
stratification
predominate
in
the
upper
water
column
.
Depth
profiles
from
the
equatorial
Atlantic
even
suggest
that
C.
albatrosianum
is
a
thermocline-dwelling
species
(
Janofske
and
Karwath
,
2000
)
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
coccolithophorid
species
Florisphaera
profunda
(
e.g.
Vink
et
al.
,
2003
)
.
It
thus
appears
to
possess
a
previously
underestimated
potential
for
the
reconstruction
of
temporal
fluctuations
in
thermocline
and
nutricline
depth
and
temperature
.
In
strong
contrast
,
Caracomia
arctica
can
be
considered
as
an
indicator
for
low
SST
and
a
well-mixed
upper
water
column
.
Relationships
between
calcareous
cyst
abundances
and
the
trophic
state
of
the
upper
water
column
are
more
difficult
to
quantify
.
Nevertheless
,
dinocysts
could
play
an
important
role
in
reconstructing
primary
production
,
especially
in
open
ocean
regions
where
many
species
are
still
abundant
despite
the
low
nutrient
levels
.
The
distributions
of
Pernambugia
tuberosa
,
Calciodinellum
elongatum
and
Scrippsiella
regalis
appear
to
be
mainly
restricted
to
the
oligotrophic
regions
(
perhaps
due
to
the
harsh
competition
with
other
phytoplankton
for
nutrients
and
light
in
the
more
productive
regions
)
,
whereas
species
such
as
Thoracosphaera
heimii
,
Leonella
granifera
,
Calciodinellum
levantinum
and
Caracomia
arctica
do
occur
in
relatively
high
concentrations
in
nutrient-rich
areas
or
in
regions
where
a
well-developed
DCM
is
present
within
the
photic
zone
.
Temporal
fluctuations
in
the
relative
and
absolute
abundances
of
these
species
can
thus
provide
important
qualitative
,
if
not
semi-quantitative
,
information
on
past
productivity
changes
.
Moreover
,
L.
granifera
shows
an
extremely
interesting
,
restricted
distribution
in
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
,
as
well
as
in
the
Arabian
Sea
(
Wendler
et
al.
,
2002b
)
,
which
may
be
of
great
palaeoenvironmental
significance
.
In
addition
to
its
positive
reaction
to
nutrient
enrichment
,
high
abundances
occur
in
regions
influenced
by
major
river
discharge
and/or
continental
dust
supply
,
which
strongly
suggests
that
cyst
production
of
this
species
is
influenced
by
the
input
of
particular
land-derived
nutrients
or
minerals
into
the
ocean
.
Further
analyses
are
urgently
required
in
order
to
verify
or
discard
this
theory
.
Concluding
,
one
could
argue
that
calcareous
dinocysts
are
just
as
adequate
as
planktonic
foraminifera
or
coccolithophorids
for
palaeotemperature
and
palaeoproductivity
reconstructions
.
In
fact
,
they
may
even
be
more
suitable
than
foraminifera
for
subsurface
water
reconstructions
,
as
the
distributions
of
their
living
counterparts
are
restricted
to
the
euphotic
zone
and
vertical
migration
through
the
water
column
is
much
less
likely
(
which
often
leads
to
submergence
,
displacement
and
survival
of
foraminifera
in
the
deeper
parts
of
moving
water
masses
over
many
hundreds
of
kilometres
away
from
the
production
area
,
e.g.
Boltovskoy
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
However
,
it
is
important
that
we
gather
more
information
on
the
regional
depth
distribution
patterns
and
reproduction/calcification
depths
of
living
cyst-producing
species
in
the
upper
water
column
in
order
to
pinpoint
their
exact
depth
habitats
prior
to
,
for
example
,
transfer
function
development
.
Additional
surface
water
sample
analyses
from
different
regions
and
seasons
,
and
the
determination
of
possible
relationships
with
the
physical
and
chemical
characteristics
of
these
waters
,
are
essential
.
Such
studies
may
additionally
answer
important
questions
concerning
the
timing
and
conditions
of
encystment
in
the
different
species
.
Water
samples
from
selected
regions
of
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
and
Mediterranean
Sea
are
currently
being
analysed
by
A.
Vink
and
S.
Meier
,
respectively
.
The
future
application
of
calcareous
cysts
to
palaeoceanographic
reconstructions
will
obviously
also
benefit
from
more
detailed
sediment
studies
which
cover
a
broader
range
of
environments
,
especially
beyond
the
South
and
equatorial
Atlantic
Ocean
.
Moreover
,
detailed
information
from
sediment
trap
studies
is
absolutely
essential
in
order
to
:
(
1
)
improve
our
knowledge
on
seasonal
and
inter-annual
population
dynamics
,
and
(
2
)
provide
more
insight
into
the
various
modes
of
transformation
between
living
dinoflagellate
communities
and
the
fossil
assemblages
in
deep-sea
sediments
,
through
processes
such
as
vertical
and
lateral
transport
,
resuspension
and/or
dilution
.
Furthermore
,
ecological
traits
of
calcareous
cyst-producing
dinoflagellates
can
often
be
determined
from
laboratory
experiments
,
in
which
particular
species
are
tested
for
their
optimal
production
range
along
broad
environmental
gradients
such
as
temperature
,
salinity
,
light
and
water
movement/turbulence
.
Such
tests
have
been
carried
out
on
Thoracosphaera
heimii
(
Karwath
,
2000
)
,
but
detailed
analyses
of
cyst
species
are
generally
still
lacking
.
Despite
many
of
the
restrictions
described
above
,
the
results
of
surface
sediment
analysis
clearly
accentuate
the
palaeoenvironmental
reconstruction
potential
hidden
in
many
calcareous
dinocyst
assemblages
,
and
I
urge
that
these
be
further
exploited
in
future
palaeoenvironmental
and
palaeoceanographic
research
.
