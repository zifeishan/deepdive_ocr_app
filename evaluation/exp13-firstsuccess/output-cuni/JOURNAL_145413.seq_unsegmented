The

of
the

is
locally
a
very
coaly,
black
humic
clay,
with
a
maximum
thick-
of
ca.
50
cm.
A
number
of
leaf-compressions
were
collected
from
this
layer
during
the
late
sum-
of
1982.
In
addition
some
samples
for
fruit/seed
analysis
were
taken
from
the
base
as
well
as
the
top
of
this
clay
bed.
Moreover,
a
sample
was
collected
from
a
banded
clay
in
a
riverchannel
at
the
top
of
the
sand
bed
(9
B).
During
the
summer
of
1983
a
section
of
the
9
C
clay
beds
was
sampled
from
top
to
bottom,
and
in
1995
a
number
of
leaf-compressions
were
collected
from
a
comparable
position
in
a
silt,
which
graded
at
the
top
into
a
silty
reddish
clay
with
the
well
known
allochthonous
leaf-compressions.

infened
from
the
situation
in

this
deposit
represents
a
lateral
equivalent
of
that
of
1982/1983.
The
leaf
and
fruit/seed
assemblages
from
both
collections
have
been
studied
and
the
results
are
reproduced
here.
The
leaves
were
identified
with
the
help
of
cuticle
analysis
as
well
as
gross
morphology.
However,
the
material
of
1995
did
not
yield
very
good
cuticle
preparations.
Ca.
2
kg
of
dried
clay
or
silt
were
taken
from
the
leaf
containing
specimens
of
both
collections,
disaggregated
with
H.O.
10o/o
and
sieved.
The
same
method
has
also
been
employed
for
processing
the
other
fruit/seed
samples.
After
drying,
the
material
was
sorted
and
the
disseminules
counted.
The
eco-
analysis

It
is
possible
to
draw
a
number
of
interesting
con-
clusions
from
a
comparison
of
the
megafossil
and
microfossil
assemblages
(see
Table
I).
On
the
one
hand,
the
dominance
of
Ainus
in
the
leaf-
and
dias-
pore
assemblages,
which
is
taken
as
evidence
of
an
alder
carr,
is
corroborated
hy
the
pollen
record.
Like-
wise,
plants
of
reed
and
streamside
vegetation
are
found
in
both
the
megafossil
and
microfossil
assem-
blages.
On
the
other
hand,
a
number
of
qualitative
and
quantitative
differences
are
apparent.
Thus
56ato
of
the
seed
plant
families
are
only
represented
by
ei-
ther
leaves/diaspores
or
pollen.
This
could
mean
any
of
a
number
of
things
(Ferguson,
1995),
e.g.
(I)
the
dispersed
organs
are
not
all
easily
identified,
(2)
the
plant
parts
display
different
potentials
for
fossiliza-
tion,
or
(3)
some
of
the
plants
did
not
grow
close
to
the
depositional
area.
The
spheroidal,
inapertu-
rate
pollen
of
Cupressaceae
is
difficult
to
differentiate
from
those
of
a
number
of
other
gymnosperms.
On
the
other
hand,
Populus
and
Magnoliaceae
pollen
and
those
of
many
aquatic
plants
do
not
fossilize
well.
However,
these
two
factors
are
not
responsible
for
all
the
differences.
The
hetter
representation
in
the
pollen
record
of
broad-leaved
trees
requiring
good
drainage
point
to
an
extra-local
origin
for
(some
of)
these
elements
(Potter,
1976).
This
could
explain
why
Quercus
is
qualitatively
and
quantitatively

resented
in
the
pollen
record.
However,
judging
from
the
presence
of
Tilia
pollen,
which
is
poorly
dispersed
(Keatinge,
1982),
these
trees
were
probably
growing
on
hammocks
not
far
from
the
site
of
deposition.
The
lack
of
any
megafossils
of
the
Pinaceae,
which
also
prefer
well-drained
sites,
is
noteworthy.
As
abscised
cones
and
needles
of
the
Pinaceae
are
only
found
close
to
their
source,
these
would
have
little
chance
of
being
incorporated
into
the
clastic
sediments
if
the
parent
plants
were
growing
on
dunes.
Pollen
of
the
Empetraceae
and
Ericaceae
could
indicate
that
these
shrubs
played
a
part
in
the
undergrowth
of
such
pinewoods.
On
the
other
hand
they
could
imply
a
cer-
tain
amount
of
heathland
vegetation.
There
is
no
sign
of
this
in
the
megafossil
record.
The
section
through
the
9
C
clay
bed
(Table
2,
samples
g
â€”
o,
14378
â€”
14386)
reveals
a
difference
be-
tween
the
lower
three
samples
and
the
uppermost
six
samples
(Fig.
2.)
The
samples
g
â€”
i
show
a
strictly
local
taphocoenosis
of
only
19
taxa.
In
these
the
species
mostly
occurring
in
wetland
forest
are
dom-
inant.
In
the
upper
part
of
the
sequence,
the
flora
is
much
more
diverse.
In
addition
to
the
species
of
the
alder
forest,
several
species
of
open
grassland
and
especially
reed
marsh
are
present;
one
species
has
disappeared:
Sambucus
pulchella.
Moreover
a
number
of
species
from
'floodplain
forest'
and
even
'upland
forest'
are
present.
The
sediment
is
more
silty,
the
macroscopical
remains
are
scarce
and
in
the
uppermost
sample
(Table
2,
o,
14378)
the
matrix
is
a
sandy
clay.
Based
on
this
a
drowning
of
the
site
resulting
in
wetter
conditions
with
a
more
open
vegetation
is
postulated.
The
vegetation
consisted
of
a
mosaic
of
alder
forest
and
reedmarsh.
In
this
situ-
ation
the
river
had
easier
access
to
the
site
and
this
resulted
in
the
presence
of
several
allochthonous
flo-
ral
elements.
The
uppermost
two
samples
show
the
strongest
allochthonous
influence
(greatest
number
of
vegetational
units
represented).
Furthermore,
a
slight
reversion
in
the
vegetational
development
is
visible
in
sample
14382,
resulting
in
a
drier
phase
with
codominance
between
'wetland
forest'
and
'reedland
vegetation'.
This
transition
from
a
strictly
local
flora
to
a
more
diverse,
allochthonously
influenced
one
enables
us
to
unravel
the
ecology
of
the
individual
taxa.
From
their
presence
in
the
alder
forest,
it
is
clear
that
Actini-
dia
faveolata,
Sambucus
pulchella,
and
Sorbus
au-
euparia
were
inhabitants
of
the
alder
forest.
Another
interesting
thing
is
that,
based
on
their
recent
ecology,
Carex
cespitosa,
Solanum
dulcamara
and
Urtica
du-
bia
would
be
expected
to
be
present
in
the
alder
forest,
However,
although
regularly
present
in
the
section,
they
were
absent
from
the
pure
alder
forest.
The
presence
of
Spirematospermum
~et-leri
in
pure
alder
forest
as
well
as
in
somewhat
more
open
habitats,
together
with
larger
numbers
in
these
open
reedland
vegetation
units
points
to
an
ecology,
which
centers
on
open
reedmarsh
vegetation.
The
carpological
assemblages
from
samples
of
the
base
of
the
9
C
clay
bed
(nos.
14132,
17647,
17648,
Table
2,
b
â€”
d)
agree
most
with
the
assem-
blages
of
the
middle
part
of
the
section
(Fig.
3).
Once
again
the
reedland
vegetation
dominated,
although
accompanied
by
some
elements
from
floodplain
for-
est
(Vitis
sylvestris,
Acer
sp.,
Carpinus
betulus).
So,
despite
the
strongly
autochthonous
signature
of
these
samples,
one
must
conclude
that
these
samples
rep-
resent
a
more
open
vegetation.
The
carpological
assemblages
of
the
top
of
the
9
C
clay
bed
(nos.
14375,
14376,
14377,
17646,
Table
2,
r
â€”
u)
display
the
best
agreement
with
those
from
the
top
of
the
section,
being
much
more
diverse
and
in
some
cases
strongly
allochthonously
influenced
(Fig.
3).
The
assemblage
from
the
channel
deposit
(sam-
ple
14149)
(Table
2,
w)
just
below
the
onset
of
the
Upper
Brunssumian
basal
clay
deposit
shows
a
typical
spectrum
of
an
allochthonous
assemblage:
several
(6)
vegetation
units
are
represented,
and
al-
though
vegetation
units
2
and
3
(streamside
vegeta-
tion
and
wetland-forest)
dominate
the
sample,
their
dominance
is
not
very
great.
The
material
contains
some
typical
allochthonous
influences,
not
found
in
the
overlying
clay
bed,
e.g.
Glyptostrobus
eu-
ropaeus,
Eucommia
europaea,
N~
ssa
disseminata,
Sparganium
noduliferum
(Fig.
3).
The
carpological
assemblage
from
the
1982
leaf
bed
(sample
18169)
closely
resembles
the
car-
pocoenoses
collected
from
the
middle
part
of
the
sec-
tion
through
the
9
C
clay
bed,
although
'Floodplain
forest'
is
not
present
in
sample
18169
(Fig.
2).
Once
again
local
vegetation
dominated.
The
similarity
to
the
samples
with
only
local
vegetation
in
the
lower
part
of
the
1983
section
(samples

less
marked,

open
grass-
and
reedland
vegetation
elements
(Carex
cespitosa,
C.

Lycopus
europaeus,
Oenanthe
lachenalii,
Sparganium
neglectum,
Stachys
palustris,
Spirematospermum
civet-leri,
Urtica
dubia)
(Fig.
2).
The
resemblance
to
the
assemblages
from
samples
14132,
17647
and
17648
(Table
2,
h
â€”
d)
from
the
basal
part
of
the
clay
hed
is
also
striking
(Fig.
3).
The
carpological
signature
of
the
leaf
bed
(sample
18170)
(Table
2,
v),
collected
in
1995
is
different.
The
matrix
consisted
of
a
silt.
The
assemblage
shows
stronger
allochthonous
influences,
e.g.
it
contains
disseminules
from
at
least
6
different
vegetation
units,
including
floodplain
forest
and
upland
forest.
In
agreement
with
this
is
the
very
strong
dominance
of
reed
vegetation.
Although
it
was
collected
from
the
basal
portion
of
the
clay
hed,
its
content
is
comparable
with
that
of
the
uppermost
part
of
the
section
of
the
clay
hed
collected
in
1983
(sample
14378,
14379)
and
the
other
samples
from
the
top
of
the
clay
hed
(Figs.
2
and
3;
Table
2,
n,
o,
r
â€”
u).
From
the
above
it
can
be
concluded
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
river
environment
with
various
vegeta-
tional
and
sedimentological
environments.
The
result
is
a
selies
of
clays,
containing
autochthonous
asselll-
hlages,
and
silts
or
sandy
clays
with
allochthonous
elements.
In
the
clays
as
well
as
in
the
silt
leaf
compressions
were
found.
The
assemblage
in
the
clay
horizon
was
probably
only
slightly
influenced
hy
the
extra
lo-
cal
vegetation
(comparable
to
the
middle
part
of
the
section
14386
â€”
14378);
the
silt
assemblage
was
possibly
derived
from
communities
growing
under
wetter
conditions,
with
direct
river
influence,
hence
the
coarser
sediment.
During
the
analysis
of
these
leaf
compressions
not
only
a
difference
between
these
two
assemblages
was
found,
but
also
a
marked
distinction
with
the
accompanying
carpological
as-
semblages
(Fig.
4).
The
leaf
assemblage
from
the
clay
bed
displays
a
strong
representation
of
leaves
from
the
'flood-
plain
forest',
fewer
from
the
'wetland
forest'
and
a
poor
showing
of
'streamside
vegetation'
and
'upland
forest'.
The
leaves
of
Ainus
cecropiaefolia
virtually
dominate
the
assemblage
(62o/o).
However,
material
from
forest
on
somewhat
higher,
hetter
drained
allu-
vial
soils
is
also
important,
consisting
of
some
more
species
(at
least
4)
and
constituting
altogether
287o
of
the
leaf
compressions.
This
is
in
marked
contrast
to
the
composition
of
the
fruit/seed
assemblages
from
the
same
deposit.
The
latter
is
typically
autochthonous,
consisting
of
material
of
the
local
vegetation
and
its
immediate
surroundings.
It
consists
of
'open
water
vegetation',
'streamside
and
reed
vegetation',
and
'wetland
forest
vegetation'.
The
very
fine
clay
points
to
quiet
deposi-
tional
circumstances,
allowing
for
a
dominance
of
the
local
vegetation
which,
judging
from
the
numerous
branches
must
have
been
a
mixture
of
reedland
and
alder
forest.
As
the
flora
of
the
hetter
drained
floodplain
is
not
represented
in
the
carpological
material,
one
may
assume,
that
this
flora
was
extralocal
with
reference
to
our
source
locality.
That
certain
taxa
are
only
rep-
resented
hy
leaves
is
due
to
the
operation
of
different
transport
mechanisms
(wind
and
water
versus
water),
which
causes
the
leaf
compression
flora
to
he
more
allochthonous
than
the
carpological
assemblage.
The
leaf
compressions
of
the
bed
sampled
in
1995
represent
a
different
origin.
Ainus
cecropiaefolia
is
no
longer
dominant,
but
A.
incana,
a
tree
from
the
hetter
drained
and
less
often
inundated
floodplains.
It
dominates
the
leaf
compression
flora
by
attaining
a
percentage
of
727o.
The
second
most
important
com-
munity
is
the
'streamside
vegetation',
here
extremely
rich
in
reeds.
The
'wetland
forest'
vegetation
is
only
third
in
importance.
The
carpological
material
of
this
horizon
also
displays
marked
allochthonous
influences
as
stated
above,
but
the
local
reed
vegetation
dominates
the
assemblage.
Some
parallels
can
be
found
with
the
carpological
and
leaf
assemblages
collected
in
1982:
in
both
the
leaf
and
carpological
assemblages
of
1995
the
allochthonous
element
as
well
as
the
streamside
vegetation
element
are
better
represented
than
in
those
from
1982.
The
better
representa-
tion
of
the
streamside
vegetation
element
is
expli-
cable
when
this
represented
the
local
vegetation.
Consequently
the
other
elements
(open
water
veg-
etation,
diverse
forest
vegetations)
must
have
ar-
rived
by
transport.
This
is
also
the
case
in
the
leaf
compression
assemblage.
The
forest
vegeta-
tion
is
strongly
dominated
hy
allochthonous
el-
ements;
so
again
the
leaf
compression
flora
is
more
allochthonous
than
the
carpocoenosis.
This
underscores
the
idea
that
the
taphonomic
history
of
leaves
is
different
from
that
of
seeds/fruits.
The
best
fit
for
this
flora
is,
as
already
mentioned,
with
the
top
of
the
sequence
14386
â€”
14378
and
with
the
top
clay
sample
17646.
