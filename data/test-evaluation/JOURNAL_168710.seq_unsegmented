Sr isotopes of the Seoguipo Formation (Korea) and their application to geologic age Abstract The Seoguipo Formation, Cheju Island, Korea is a shallow-marine to nonmarine sedimentary formation formed by the earliest stage of volcanism and simultaneous volcanogenic sedimentation of the island. The formation contains signatures of glacioeustasy, providing an opportunity to study Neogene paleoceanographic changes in the northwestern Pacific. The proposed geologic age of the formation varies widely from Pliocene to Pleistocene in spite of an abundance of biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data. This situation has hampered establishment of a time framework on which paleoenvironmental interpretations can be based. In this study, strontium isotopic ratios were measured from diverse macrofossils obtained from the fossiliferous lower part of the formation to constrain the carbonate ages. All macrofossils retain the original mineralogy and microstructures, negating the possibility of postdepositional diagenesis. The stable oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the specimens also show little sign of alteration. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the shells display a wide range of values (0.70863–0.70919), categorized into two groups; calcitic pectenids, brachiopods, and an aragonitic bivalve showing high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (greater than 0.70909), and the rest of bivalves and an aragonitic gastropod showing unusually low values. The low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the latter group are interpreted to be due to the local variation of the paleoseawater condition in which the organisms grew, probably caused by contemporaneous volcanic activities and weathering of volcaniclastic materials in a restricted environment. The average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the heavy group yields a carbonate age of 0.86 (+0.40/−0.57) Ma by the LOWESS fit to the marine Sr-isotope curve of Howarth and McArthur (J. Geol., 105 (1997) 441). The Sr isotope age, in conjunction with radiometric and biostratigraphic ages, suggests that the deposition of the Seoguipo Formation began since the early Pleistocene, and the surface exposure of the formation belongs mostly to the middle Pleistocene (∼0.86–0.4 Ma). Keywords Seoguipo Formation ; Isotopes ; Geologic age 1. Introduction The Seoguipo Formation, located in Cheju Island, Korea ( Fig. 1 ), is a volcaniclastic and fossiliferous, shallow marine to nonmarine sedimentary formation of probable Pliocene–Pleistocene age ( Yokoyama, 1923 and Haraguchi, 1931 ). The formation is the lowermost volcanogenic stratigraphic unit of Cheju Island, underlain by unconsolidated quartzofeldspathic sand and silt of unknown age and overlain by voluminous lava flows and minor amounts of pyroclastic deposits that have K–Ar ages between ca. 0.9 and 0.03 Ma ( Tamanyu, 1990 , Lee et al., 1994 and Koh, 1997 ). The formation crops out only along the south-central coast of Cheju Island near the Seoguipo city ( Fig. 1b) , but is encountered in many boreholes almost all around the island ( Koh et al., 1992 , Koh et al., 1993 and Koh, 1997 ). The Seoguipo Formation is thought to record the earliest stage of volcanism and simultaneous volcanogenic sedimentation in Cheju Island. Sedimentary facies analysis ( Yoon, 1995 and Yoon et al., 1995 ) and geochemical analysis of molluscan fossils ( Woo et al., 1995 , Kim et al., 1999 and Khim et al., 2000 ) suggest that the formation comprises several transgressive and regressive cycles most likely resulting from the Neogene glacioeustasy, providing an opportunity to study Neogene paleoceanographic changes in the northwestern Pacific. The stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental importance of the formation has intrigued a number of geologists to constrain the age of the formation since the early twentieth century ( Yokoyama, 1923 , Haraguchi, 1931 , Kim, 1972 , You et al., 1987 , Yoon, 1988 , Yi et al., 1998 , Lee, 1990 , Tamanyu, 1990 and Li et al., 1999 ). In spite of these efforts, however, the age of the formation is still controversial and poorly constrained, ranging from Pliocene to Pleistocene ( Table 1 ). One of the reasons for this controversy is the lack of radiometrically datable materials beneath this formation and the variability of volcanic rock units and their ages (ca. 0.9–0.4 Ma) above this formation. This situation has hampered proper understanding of the geologic history of Cheju Island and the establishment of a time framework on which paleoenvironmental interpretations can be based. Since Burke et al. (1982) compiled the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios during the Phanerozoic, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic variations in marine carbonates have received growing attention as a valuable chronostratigraphic tool ( DePaolo and Ingram, 1985 , DePaolo, 1986 , Elderfield, 1986 , Hess et al., 1986 , Hodell et al., 1990 , Howarth and McArthur, 1997 and Veizer et al., 1999 ). The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of the world's oceans has varied over the geologic time, allowing the development of a temporal calibration curve for age determination during the Phanerozoic. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of seawater has followed an increasing trend over the last 40 million years ( Koepnick et al., 1985 and Hess et al., 1986 ) and increased linearly for the last 2.5 million years ( Hodell et al., 1989 and Hodell et al., 1991 ). Thus, the strontium isotopic variations of the late Tertiary age provide a good geochronomer ( Hodell et al., 1989 , Hodell et al., 1991 and Farrell et al., 1995 ). The usefulness of this secular curve is based on three assumptions: (1) the strontium isotopic composition of the oceanic reservoir is homogeneous at any given time because of a long residence time of strontium (2–3 Ma) relative to the short mixing cycle of the oceans (about 1000 years); (2) there is no disequilibrium or vital effect when the uptake of strontium from seawater occurs; and (3) the significant change of strontium isotopic composition through geologic time is rapid enough to allow temporal determination. In this paper, we apply Sr-chronostratigraphy to the Seoguipo Formation in order to constrain the age of the formation and explain the anomalously wide range of the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios observed in well-preserved calcareous skeletons. 2. Seoguipo Formation Cheju Island is a shield volcano that lies on the ∼100-m-deep continental shelf off the Korean Peninsula ( Fig. 1a ). The island is composed of voluminous basaltic lava flows and numerous parasitic volcanic cones that are generally less than 1 Ma old ( Won, 1976 , Lee, 1982 , Won et al., 1986 , Yun et al., 1987 , Lee et al., 1988 , Lee et al., 1994 and Park, 1994 ). Beneath the volcanic rock units is the Seoguipo Formation. The formation is present mostly in the subsurface and below the present sea level. It is about 100 m thick and overlain by ca. 50–120 m of lavas along the coastal areas ( Koh et al., 1992 , Koh et al., 1993 and Koh, 1997 ). Near the Seoguipo city ( Fig. 1b ), part of the formation crops out along a cliff wall overlain by a 0.4-Ma-old hawaiite lava ( Lee et al., 1988 ). The 60-m-thick exposure of the formation is composed of mainly basaltic volcaniclastic rocks and subordinate amounts of nonvolcanic sedimentary layers. The lower half of the exposure is characterized by shallow-marine (inner shelf to foreshore) lithofacies and alternations of fossiliferous and nonfossiliferous units ( Fig. 2 ; Yoon, 1995 ), whereas the upper half is mostly nonmarine and nonfossiliferous. A variety of fossils are contained in the fossiliferous units of the exposure, including molluscs, brachiopods, foraminifera, ostracodes, nannofossils, sponges, corals, barnacles, echinoids, shark teeth, bryozoans, and whale bones as well as prolific trace fossils in shallow marine settings ( Yokoyama, 1923 , Haraguchi, 1931 , Kim, 1972 , Kim, 1984 , Yoon, 1988 , You et al., 1987 , Paik and Lee, 1988 , Kang, 1995 , Jung et al., 1997 , Yi et al., 1998 , Kang et al., 1999 and Li et al., 1999 ). In spite of the abundant fossil records, different ages have been suggested for the Seoguipo Formation, ranging from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene based on the timescale of Shackleton et al. (1994) for the period between 0 and 7 Ma ( Table 1 ). Paleomagnetic studies also failed to resolve the debate on the age of the formation, suggesting either the late Pliocene (the Gauss normal epoch; Min et al., 1986 ) or the middle Pleistocene (the Brunhes normal epoch; Lee et al., 1988 ). The geologic age of the formation could neither be constrained by radiometric dating of volcanic rocks because of the lack of radiometrically datable materials beneath this formation and the variability of volcanic rock units and their ages (ca. 0.9–0.4 Ma) above this formation. The depositional environment of the lower part of the Seoguipo Formation has been inferred to be shallow marine (i.e. estuarine to inner shelf) on the basis of various paleontological records ( Kim, 1972 , Kim, 1984 , Paik and Lee, 1988 , Yoon, 1988 , Lee, 1990 and Kang, 1995 ). Recent lithofacies analysis revealed four depositional systems ( Yoon et al., 1995 ): (1) skeletal beach and bank system breached by tidal inlets; (2) back-bank bay and tidal flats; (3) nearshore to offshore sand/mud flats, and (4) ephemerally developed volcaniclastic delta system. Kang (1995) suggested that the inner shelf to foreshore and bay environments were affected by glacioeustatic sea-level changes. Units I, II and III ( Fig. 2 ) represent storm deposits accumulated on nearshore banks or spits and subsequently reworked by tidal currents and waves. Unit IV, thick bioturbated sandstone, consists of relict sediments winnowed by strong waves and currents on a nearshore sandbank, foreshore, and shoreface. Units V and VI are composed of fine-grained sediments, deposited offshore of the bank and bay and below the fair weather wave base. The other upper units are interpreted to be nearshore storm surge deposits and shoreface tidal sand and mud deposits above the fair weather wave base. The overall sedimentary facies show a deepening-upward trend up to Unit V, followed by shallowing-upward trend in the upper units. Yoon (1995) proposed that these two trends are associated with a relative sea-level rise and a subsequent fall, respectively. Overall, the formation comprises a deepening- to shallowing-upward megasequence with several transgressive and regressive cycles in it. 3. Materials and methods All specimens were collected from the six strata among the eight fossiliferous units of the lower part of the Seoguipo Formation ( Fig. 2 ). In this study, we used aragonitic fossils of bivalves and a gastropod as well as calcitic shells of pectenids and brachiopods ( Table 2 ). The cleaned samples were impregnated, thin-sectioned, and routinely examined by petrographic microscope to determine the state of textural preservation. For geochemical analyses, fossil specimens were drilled and micromilled. For oxygen and carbon isotopes, approximately 5 mg of the sample powders were reacted with 100% phosphoric acid at 90°C, and evolved CO 2 gas was automatically injected into the mass spectrometer (VG Prism II) to measure the isotopic ratios. Analytical precision of oxygen and carbon isotope lies within ±0.1‰. All stable isotope values are referred to PDB ( Craig, 1957 ). For Sr concentration, about 0.05–0.5 g of samples were reacted with 5% HCl, and insoluble residue was removed. The solution was measured by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-AES Shimazu 1000III). For 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio, carbonate powder samples were dissolved in 2.5 N HCl on hot plate overnight. Sr was separated by cation exchange columns filled with 200–400 mesh AG50WX-8 resin and eluted 2.5 N HCl. Separated Sr was loaded on Ta filament with a mixture of dilute (0.1 N) nitric and phosphoric acids and run as Sr+ on the VG Sector 54-30 multicollector thermal ionization mass spectrometer. Measured isotopic values were normalized to 86 Sr/ 88 =0.11940. NBS 987 yields an 87 Sr/ 86 Sr value of 0.7102322. The averaged analytical error (2 σ ) of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr was±0.000011 ( n =16). All geochemical analyses were carried out at the Korea Basic Science Institute. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Strontium isotopes of fossil shells Thin-section microphotographs of fossil specimens to judge the state of preservation are shown in Fig. 3 . All carbonate skeletons retain their original mineralogy and microstructures. Brachiopods show calcitic and foliated microstructure with punctae that penetrate the whole shells and even contain some organic matter ( Fig. 3a ). A gastropod sample is composed of unaltered aragonite that preserves cross-lamellar microstructure ( Fig. 3b ). Calcitic pectenids preserve foliated microstructure and aragonitic bivalves uphold the original mineralogy and microstructure (i.e. cross-lamellar microstructure; Fig. 3c ). Based on the petrographic observations, the calcitic brachiopods and pectenids as well as aragonitic gastropod and bivalves, used in the present geochemical study, preserve their original mineralogy and texture. Table 2 summarizes the geochemical data for fossils. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios and Sr concentrations of the fossil specimens of the Seoguipo Formation are plotted with respect to the sampling site in Fig. 4 . 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values range between 0.70863 and 0.70919 and Sr concentrations are in the range of 914–2646 ppm, with Sr contents of aragonitic shells between 1300 and 2600 ppm, whereas for calcitic shells it is 900–1200 ppm ( Table 2 ). The Sr contents of both aragonitic and calcitic shells are within the range of comparable recent analogues ( Milliman, 1974 and Masuda and Hirano, 1980 ). The Sr concentration in calcitic shells is in good agreement with the predicted value of Sr content (1100 ppm) of calcite precipitated in equilibrium with seawater ( Veizer, 1983 ). These concentrations reflect that the fossils were not chemically altered by postburial diagenesis. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Sr concentrations can be divided into two groups ( Fig. 4 ); high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios with low Sr concentration and low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios with high Sr content. The more radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr group (0.70909–0.70919) is represented by calcitic fossils and an aragonitic bivalve. This range is very close to the initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios from recent molluscs at Cheju Island ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr=0.70916–0.70918; Park et al., 1995 ). The lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr group (0.70863–0.70909) is characteristic of all other aragonitic fossils. Fig. 5 also highlights the clustering of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios into two groups. In particular, Fig. 5d displays a dense cluster for the high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and low Sr group, and wide scatter for the low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and high Sr group. Such anomalously low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values may be attributed to: (1) mineralogical effect for both aragonitic and calcitic shell; (2) diagenetic effect by meteoric fluids that was modified by surrounding volcanic rocks; (3) vital effect by organisms; (4) local effect of penecontemporaneous seawater composition; or (5) reworking of specimens from older strata. Because all aragonitic samples, except for the bivalve (SG-U1-5; 87 Sr/ 86 Sr=0.70913, Sr=2390), have lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios than the calcitic counterparts, the mineralogical difference could be considered as a possible cause. In general, oxygen and carbon isotopes are kinetically fractionated, and thus reflecting the mineralogical differences ( Anderson and Arthur, 1983 ). For Sr isotopes, kinetic fractionation was not yet reported, since the atomic weight difference between 86 Sr and 87 Sr is not large enough to be effectively fractionated. Diagenetic alteration by meteoric water may be an alternative causative factor. Brand (1991) pointed out that 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of shallow marine molluscs and brachiopods increase with progressive postdepositional alteration in the presence of diagenetic meteoric water. Since δ 18 O and δ 13 C values are analogous to modern marine counterparts ( Fig. 5a ; Anderson and Arthur, 1983 and Veizer, 1983 ), and since all shells preserve their original mineralogy and microstructure ( Fig. 3 ), this alternative is not the likely explanation of the trend. Vital effect, or disequilibrium precipitation, can cause physiologically mediated variations in elemental or isotopic composition of a skeleton, relative to inorganic precipitates ( Dodd and Stanton, 1990 ). For example, in some taxa (e.g. foraminifera, coral, and echinoderm), the oxygen and carbon isotopes are influenced by vital effects due either to kinetic effects in rapidly calcifying organisms or to metabolic effects arising from photosynthesis and respiration ( Woodruff et al., 1980 , Grossman, 1987 , McConnaughey, 1989 and Wefer and Berger, 1991 ). However, the small mass difference between 87 Sr and 86 Sr diminishes the potential for biological or kinetic fractionation ( Reinhardt et al., 1999 ). The most probable cause of low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios is therefore local variations of paleoenvironments. High Sr concentrations with relatively low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in aragonitic shells can be explained if the low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in the water were generated by weathering of widespread volcanogenic materials. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of the adjacent volcanic rocks are characterized by low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of 0.704–0.705 ( Lee, 1982 ). Most volcanogenic materials of the Seoguipo Formation were derived from basaltic glassy tuffs produced by hydrovolcanic eruptions. These glassy tuffaceous materials are easily weathered, compared with (micro)crystalline volcanic lavas that are resistant to weathering. In general, calcitic brachiopods and pectenids are regarded to be offshore dwellers, and they may well represent open water conditions. In contrast, gastropods and bivalve, except for pectenids, occupy nearshore habitats. Hence, the gastropod and aragonitic bivalves may have lived in a partially restricted environment, where the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of paleoseawater was modified by nearby volcanic activities and by weathering of glassy tuffaceous materials. This inference is supported by the sedimentological interpretation that some units of the Seoguipo Formation formed behind a bank or a spit, partially separated from the open seawater. Reworking of fossil shells from underlying strata may cause the low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio. No clear trend of isotopic ratios throughout the formation may be, however, attributed to mixing and reworking of fossil shells between different units of the formation. However, contamination by older fossils is not likely because the Seoguipo Formation is underlain by nonfossiliferous sand and silt deposits and overlain by volcanic lava flows. The mixing and reworking process seems highly likely in a shallow marine sequence that was subject to several cycles of sea-level fluctuations during its deposition. 4.2. Sr isotope age of the Seoguipo Formation The precise geologic age of the Seoguipo Formation has been debated for decades ( Table 1 ), ranging from Pliocene to Pleistocene on the basis of paleontologic and paleomagnetic investigations. The geologic age was first considered to be late Pliocene based on the occurrence of the mollusc Turrilella saisuensis ( Yokoyama, 1923 and Yoon, 1988 ). Later, Kim (1972) also proposed that the formation belongs to the Pliocene based on the occurrence of three planktonic foraminifera: Turborotalia humerosa , T. crassiformis , and Pulleniatina obliquiloculata . However, this is not justified in view of the distribution of these foraminiferal species in the world oceans at present. Recent re-analysis of planktonic foraminfiera suggests middle Pleistocene age (late N22 Zone, i.e. Globigerina calida calida Subzone, older than 400 ka) based on the presence of Globigerina calida calida , Beella digitata , Globigerina bermudezi , and Globoquadrina conglomerata ( Li et al., 1999 ). In contrast, the calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy assigns the formation to the Pseudoemiliania lacunosa Zone (NN19; Martini, 1971 ), which corresponds to the combined zones of Emiliania annula to Emiliania ovata (CN13a-CN14a; Okada and Burky, 1980 ) of the latest Pliocene to early Pleistocene age ( Yi et al., 1998 ). According to nannofossil assemblages, the lower boundary of the Seoguipo Formation is older than 1.66 Ma while the upper one is slightly younger than 0.83 Ma. The ostracode assemblage of the Seoguipo Formation suggested a Pliocene–Pleistocene interval ( Paik and Lee, 1988 ), which was subsequently revised to middle Pleistocene ( Lee, 1990 ). Similarly, a paleomagnetic polarity within the Gauss normal epoch (late Pliocene) was proposed by Min et al. (1986) , whereas Lee et al. (1988) argued that the Seoguipo Formation was formed during the Brunhes normal epoch of the middle Pleistocene. Recent K–Ar age determination of the hawaiite that unconformably overlies the Seoguipo Formation constrains the upper limit of the formation at about 0.4 Ma, but the age of the lower contact is still unclear. Lee et al. (1988) suggested that deposition of the formation occurred during the middle Pleistocene transgressive period between 0.73 (?) and 0.41 Ma. Variation of Sr isotopic compositions in seawater can serve as a chronostratigraphic tool. Precise delineation of temporal variations in the Sr isotopic composition of seawater is a prerequisite for application of this tool to stratigraphy. Several studies documented variations in Sr isotopic composition of Phanerozoic seawater ( Veizer and Compston, 1974 , Burke et al., 1982 , Hess et al., 1986 , Capo and DePaolo, 1990 , Farrell et al., 1995 and Veizer et al., 1999 ), showing a good stratigraphic control for much of the late Eocene to Recent. Among the several chronologic curves, Howarth and McArthur (1997) provided a best-fit curve to 1849 measurements of Sr isotopic data for the period between 0 and 206 Ma using the Locally Weighted regression Scatterplot Smoother (LOWESS) method. The initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios for the fossils of the Seoguipo Formation range from 0.70863 to 0.70919 ( Table 2 ). Because the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios cluster into two groups ( Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 ), with the heavier group (0.70909–0.70919) likely representing the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the contemporaneous open seawater, the heavier group (brachiopods, pectenids, and one aragonitic bivalve) was chosen to calculate the age of the Seoguipo Formation. For a precise calculation, the Sr data from an aragonite shell was discarded. Taking only calcitic fossils, the mean 87 Sr/ 86 Sr is 0.709144±0.000020 at 2 standard errors. According to the LOWESS fit of Howarth and McArthur (1997) , this gives the corresponding geologic age of 0.86 (+0.40/−0.57) Ma for the Seoguipo Formation ( Fig. 6 ). The Sr isotope age is much older than the age of the hawaiite lava (0.4 Ma; Lee et al., 1988 ) that overlies the Seoguipo Formation in the surface exposure, but corresponds approximately with the radiometric ages of some trachytic lavas (0.9–0.8 Ma; Lee et al., 1988 , Lee et al., 1994 and Koh, 1997 ) that overlie the Seoguipo Formation in the subsurface. This suggests that the deposition of the Seoguipo Formation in the subsurface began at least before 0.9 Ma during the early Pleistocene, whereas the surface exposure of the formation was deposited mostly during the middle Pleistocene between ∼0.86 and 0.4 Ma. Part of the time gap between the Sr isotope age (∼0.86 Ma) and the age of the overlying hawaiite lava (0.4 Ma) is probably represented by the nonmarine and nonfossiliferous deposits which comprise the upper half of the Seoguipo Formation. Our interpretation agrees well with the recent biostratigraphic studies based on planktonic foraminifera ( Li et al., 1999 ) and nannofossils ( Yi et al., 1998 ). The study on planktonic foraminifera obtained from the surface exposure of the Seoguipo Formation suggests that the sediments above Unit VII were deposited after 0.61 Ma whereas the underlying units were deposited earlier. This foraminiferal age corresponds well with our interpretation that the surface exposure of the formation was deposited mostly during the middle Pleistocene between ∼0.86 and 0.4 Ma. The nannofossil ages obtained from both surface exposures and subsurface cores have a wider time range, suggesting that the deposition of the Seoguipo Formation began as early as 1.66 Ma and continued until after ∼0.83 Ma. It can be concluded from these data that the deposition of the Seoguipo Formation continued for more than a million years since the early Pleistocene until 0.4 Ma, and the surface exposure of the formation represents the later part of the period, mostly belonging to the middle Pleistocene. 5. Conclusions The Seoguipo Formation, a subsurface formation outcropping only along the southern coast of Cheju Island (Korea), is composed of shallow marine to nonmarine, volcaniclastic deposits, containing numerous macro and microfossils with prolific trace fossils. Petrographic examination of fossil specimens collected from the fossiliferous lower part of the formation demonstrates that aragonitic and calcitic shells preserve their original mineralogy and microstructures, negating the possibility of significant postdepositional diagenetic alteration. Oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of the shells are also in accord with this observation. The fossil shells of the Seoguipo Formation can be divided into two groups; one with high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios and low Sr content and the other with low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios and high Sr concentrations. The latter group includes only aragonitic fossils, and the anomalously low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values are interpreted to be due to local environmental effect, i.e. the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of paleo-seawater was influenced by contemporaneous volcanic activities and weathering of glassy tuffaceous materials in a partially restricted environment. Based on the LOWESS fit ( Howarth and McArthur, 1997 ) for the heavy Sr isotopes of calcitic fossils, the average value of the radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr group yields an age estimate of 0.86 (+0.40/−0.57) Ma. Compilation of radiometric, biostratigraphic, and Sr isotopic ages suggest that the deposition of the Seoguipo Formation continued for more than a million years since the early Pleistocene until 0.4 Ma, and the surface exposure of the formation represents the later part of the period, mostly belonging to the middle Pleistocene (∼0.86–0.4 Ma).
