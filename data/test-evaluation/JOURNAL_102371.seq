Changes
in
monsoon
and
ocean
circulation

the
vegetation
cover
of
southwest
Sumatra
through
the
last
83,000
years
:
The
record
from
marine
core
BAR94-42
Abstract
We
present
the
palynological
record
from
deep-sea
core
BAR94-42
taken
offshore
of
southwest
Sumatra
in
the
Indian
Ocean
.
Refinement
of
a
previous
age
model
for
the
core
has
been
made
using
7
additional
radiocarbon
ages
and
29
additional
oxygen-isotope
measurements
.
These
analyses
have
substantially
improved
the
previously
published
chronology
,
which
has
enabled
revision
of
the
results
of
sedimentological
studies
of
the
core
.
The
pollen
and
re-interpreted
biogenic
and
terrigeneous
data
were
used
to
reconstruct
monsoon
circulation
and
vegetation
of
southwest
Sumatra
over
the
last
83,000
years
(
83
kyr
)
.
During
marine
isotope
stage
(
MIS
)
5a
,
southwest
Sumatra
was
covered
by
rainforest
,
with
open
herbaceous
swamps
lining
river
courses
and
surrounding
lakes
.
The
SE
component
of
the
monsoon
was
stronger
than
the
NW
component
,
resulting
in
a
humid
climate
with
a
short
,
dry
season
.
During
MIS
4
,
conditions
were
drier
,
fire
activity
increased
and
the
monsoon
was
generally
weaker
.
This
latter
pattern
persisted
until
MIS1
.
The
vegetation
was
most
open
during
MIS
3
,
between
~
52
and
43
kyr
;
identifying
this
phase
as
the
driest
of
the
last
glacial
.
An
increase
in
montane
trees
from
~
52
kyr
indicates
the
onset
of
cooler
conditions
,
which
lasted
until
the
transition
to
MIS
1
at
about
11.9
kyr
.
After
~
43
kyr
,
an
everwet
climate
gradually
developed
as
monsoonal
circulation
intensified
and
the
SE
monsoon
component
became
stronger
.
During
this
time
,
closed-canopy
rainforest
became
dominant
regionally
over
southwest
Sumatra
.
Increased
monsoonal
activity
during
the
early
Holocene
resulted
in
increased
precipitation
,
river
runoff
,
sediment
discharge
and
offshore
sediment
transport
from
the
continental
shelf
.

Introduction
Most
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
complex
forests
of
the
Indonesian
archipelago
has
been
derived
from
palynological
studies
,
with
many
pollen
records
obtained
from
peat
and
fluvial
swamp
deposits
in
highland
and
lowland
areas
(
Kershaw
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
In
general
,
the
highland
sequences
offer
mostly
continuous
records
of
past
changes
through
the
last
40,000
years
(
40
kyr
)
and
provide
clear
evidence
of
cooler
glacial
conditions
,
but
shed
little
light
on
changes
in
the
amount
and
seasonal
distribution
of
precipitation
.
By
contrast
,
many
of
the
lowland
sequences
,
although
comparable
in
time-span
,
are
discontinuous
and
,
consequently
,
often
miss
(
much
)
of
the
last
glacial
period
.
For
some
time
,
what
is
known
of
the
history
of
variations
in
past
vegetation
and
,
increasingly
,
climate
of
the
region
has
been
derived
from
pollen
records
from
marine
cores
(
Kershaw
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
These
records
have
provided
(
relatively
)
well
dated
,
(
mainly
)
continuous
pictures
of
changes
in
the
lowland
tropical
forests
through
glacial
–
interglacial
cycles
.
In
addition
,
these
data
are
now
most
often
fully
integrated
with
oceanographic
reconstructions
of
sea-surface
temperature
,
salinity
(
d18Osw
)
and
palaeoproductivity
estimates
through
which
past
variations
in
monsoonal
activity
can
be
assessed
.
Previous
palynological
studies
of
Sumatra
have
been
limited
to
the
highlands
of
the
centre
and
north
of
the
island
and
include
Danau
Padang
at
950
m
asl
(
Morley
,
1982
)
,
Rawa
Sikijang
at
1100
m
asl
(
Flenley
and
Butler
,
2001
)
,
Danau
di
Atas
at
1535
m
asl
(
Newsome
and
Flenley
,
1988
;
Stuijts
et
al
,
1988
)
,
Pea
Bullok
at
1400
m
asl
(
Maloney
and
McCormac
,
1995
)
,
Pea
Sim-sim
at
1450
m
asl
(
Maloney
,
1980
and
Maloney
,
1985
)
and
Toa
Sipinggan
at
1445
m
asl
(
Maloney
,
1985
)
.
A
combination
of
these
records
provides
a
vegetation
record
covering
the
last
35
kyr
that
shows
maintenance
of
near
continuous
rainforest
cover
during
the
last
glacial
period
,
including
the
Last
Glacial
Maximum
(
LGM
)
,
with
clear
movement
of
montane
trees
to
lower
altitudes
at
most
of
these
sites
.
This
indicates
cooler
conditions
than
at
present
during
the
last
glacial
period
.
At
Danau
di
Atas
,
a
temperature
lowering
of
about
6
°
C
is
inferred
for
the
LGM
(
Newsome
and
Flenley
,
1988
;
Stuijts
et
al.
,
1988
)
.
Evidence
for
human
impact
in
the
study
area
comes
from
two
sites
where
swidden
cultivation
(
slash-and-burn
)
of
dry
(
non-irrigated
)
rice
or
root
crops
are
inferred
as
early
as
8.2
kyr
BP
at
Danau
di
Atas
(
Newsome
and
Flenley
,
1988
)
and
8
kyr
BP
at
Pea
Bullok
(
Maloney
and
McCormac
,
1995
)
.
In
southwest
Sumatra
palynological
studies
are
lacking
and
the
nearest
sites
are
located
on
West
Java
and
include
Rawa
Danau
at
90
m
asl
(
van
der
Kaars
et
al.
,
2001a
,
van
der
Kaars
et
al.
,
2001b
and
Turney
et
al.
,
2006
)
,
Situ
Bayongbong
at
1300
m
asl
(
Stuijts
,
1984
,
Stuijts
,
1993
and
Stuijts
et
al.
,
1988
)
and
Bandung
Basin
at
665
m
asl
(
van
der
Kaars
and
Dam
,
1995
,
van
der
Kaars
and
Dam
,
1997
and
van
der
Kaars
,
1998
)
.
The
record
from
the
highland
site
at
Situ
Bayongbong
provides
considerable
evidence
for
the
maintenance
of
rainforest
and
significant
movement
of
montane
trees
to
lower
altitudes
during
the
last
glacial
period
.
At
the
lower
altitude
sites
,
Rawa
Danau
and
Bandung
Basin
,
increased
representation
of
montane
elements
are
also
recorded
during
the
last
glacial
period
.
However
,
at
both
these
locations
,
it
appears
that
,
during
the
last
glacial
,
closed-canopy
forest
vegetation
was
at
least
partly
replaced
by
open
grasslands
(

der

Marine
core
BAR94-42
(
Fig.

)
has
been
the
focus
of
a
number
of
studies
(
see
De
Deckker
and
Gingele
,
2002
and
Gingele
et
al.
,
2002
)
and
covers
the
last
83
kyr
.
In
this
present
paper
,
we
report
on
the
results
of
palynological
analysis
of
this
core
,
and
provide
a
continuous
record
of
vegetation
change
for
southwest
Sumatra
covering
the
past
83
kyr
,
thereby
extending
the
known
vegetation
history
of
Sumatra
by
an
additional
45
kyr
.
The
results
will
be
discussed
in
conjunction
with
a
revised
interpretation
of
the
results
of
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
in
order
to
reconstruct
monsoonal
circulation
and
aspects
of
the
concurrent
oceanographic
conditions
in
the
adjacent
Indian
Ocean
.
The
pollen
record
provides
the
first
information
on
vegetation
history
of
the
lowlands
of
Sumatra
and
contributes
to
ongoing
investigations
into
the
extent
of
the
everwet
core
of
the
rainforest
in
the
Indonesian
region
during
the
last
glacial
period
(

.
Our
contribution
is
the
first
of
a
planned
series
that
will
present
a
range
of
proxy
evidence
for
Late
Quaternary
environmental
change
derived
from
a
line
of
marine
cores
from
the
Indian
Ocean
that
transects
the
area
from
North
Sumatra
to
Flores
.

Environmental
setting
2.1
.
Regional
and
local
climates
The
present
climate
across
the
Indonesian
region
is
governed
by
monsoonal
circulation
,
the
migration
of
the
Intertropical
Convergence
Zone
(
ITCZ
)
,
as
well
as
the
land
–
ocean
distribution
in
the
Malay
Archipelago
(
Verstappen
,
1975
and
Monk
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
During
the
austral
summer
,
the
northwest
monsoon
gathers
large
amounts
of
moisture
while
crossing
the
sea
from
the
Asian
high-pressure
belt
on
its
way
to
the
ITCZ
,
which
reaches
northern
Australia
in
January
.
At
the
ITCZ
,
the
moisture-laden
air
rises
,
resulting
in
heavy
rains
over
Indonesia
and
northern
Australia
,
while
south
of
the
ITCZ
,
precipitation
decreases
rapidly
.
During
the
austral
winter
,
the
southeast
monsoon
originates
from
the
Southern
Hemisphere
high-pressure
belt
and
is
relatively
dry
and
cool
,
but
gathers
moisture
as
it
crosses
the
eastern
Indonesian
waters
on
its
way
to
the
ITCZ
which
,
in
July
,
reaches
the
mainland
of
Southeast
Asia
.
A
major
geographic
feature
that
drives
climate
within
the
region
is
the
Indo
Pacific
Warm
Pool
(
IPWP
)
that
plays
a
significant
role
in
transferring
global
heat
and
moisture
between
ocean
and
atmosphere
and
,
in
doing
so
,
is
considered
to
be
the
world
's
‘
heat
engine
’
.
Specifically
,
heat
and
moisture
rising
from
the
IPWP
drive
the
zonal
Walker
and
meridional
Hadley
circulation
cells
making
the
IPWP
an
important
source
of
precipitation
for
the
(
austral
)
summer
monsoon
.
Much
of
this
heat
and
moisture
is
derived
from
shallow
seas
in
the
extensive
areas
of
the
continental
shelf
,
particularly
the
Sunda
and
Sahul
Shelves
,
and
from
the
Indonesian
Throughflow
(
ITF
)
that
restricts
the
movement
of
warm
water
from
the
Pacific
to
the
Indian
Ocean
.
Thus
,
lowered
sea
levels
during
glacial
periods
are
likely
to
have
had
a
major
impact
on
the
energy
balance
and
rainfall
distribution
in
the
region
.
The
energy
provided
by
convective
activity
within
the
Maritime
Continent
(
sensu
Ramage
,
1968
)
is
the
major
contributor
to
the
operation
of
the
east
–
west
Walker
circulation
that
breaks
down
periodically
,
resulting
in
the
movement
of
the
warm
water
banked
up
against
the
ITF
eastwards
,
and
resulting
in
a
substantial
reduction
in
precipitation
from
all
sources
over
most
of
the
region
.
The
local
climate
in
the
region
of
Sumatra
and
West
Java
is
characterised
by
high
annual
precipitation
,
generally
over
2000
mm
and
a
very
feeble
or
no
dry
season
(
virtually
no
months
classified
as
dry
)
(
Fontanel
and
Chantefort
,
1978
and
Tapper
,
2002
)
(
Fig.
1
)
.
The
climate
of
southwest
Sumatra
in
the
area
adjacent
to
the
BAR94-42
core
site
and
four
key
records
in
the
region
is
presented
in
Fig.
2
.
The
easternmost
site
,
The
Bandung
Basin
,
experiences
the
greatest
rainfall
and
seasonality
of
all
locations
discussed
herewith
,
while
the
most
western
site
,
Pim
Sim-sim
,
experiences
the
most
equably
distributed
rainfall
and
the
least
variability
.
On
Sumatra
,
the
period
with
lowest
rainfall
is
three
months
(
JJA
)
and
is
shorter
than
on
West
Java
where
it
lasts
four
months
(
JJAS
)
.
In
northern
and
central
Sumatra
,
the
number
of
humid
months
is
,
in
general
,
more
extensive
(
10
–
12
months
)
than
in
southern
Sumatra
and
West
Java
(
6
–
10
months
)
(
Fig.

)
.
2.2
.
Regional
and
local
vegetation
The
modern
vegetation
across
the
region
exhibits
a
pronounced
east
–
west
gradient
(
Fig.
3
)
,
following
annual
precipitation
and
the
length
of
the
dry
season
(
Fontanel
and
Chantefort
,
1978
and
Tapper
,
2002
)
.
Today
,
the
natural
vegetation
of
Sumatra
and
West
Java
is
largely
composed
of
evergreen
lowland
forest
between
sea
level
and
1000
m
,
and
evergreen
highland
forest
between
1000
m
and
3000
m
(
Collins
et
al.
,
1991
)
.
The
natural
vegetation
of
the
area
of
southwest
Sumatra
,
immediately
adjacent
to
the
core
location
,
consists
of
altitudinal
gradients
of
dense
moist
evergreen
forests
that
are
dominated
by
Dipterocarpaceae
,
with
some
swamp
forest
in
the
coastal
regions
in
the
area
below
300
m
;
in
the
area
from
300
to
1000
m
Dipterocarpaceae
,
Burseraceae
,
Euphorbiaceae
and
Myrtaceae
dominate
;
the
area
from
1000
to
1800
m
is
largely
composed
of
Fagaceae
,
Myrtaceae
,
Lauraceae
,
Hamamelidaceae
,
Dacrycarpus
imbricatus
and
Shorea
platyclados
.
Finally
,
in
the
area
from
1800
to
2700
m
,
Fagaceae
,
Magnoliacaeae
,
Dacrydium
elatum
,
Podocarpus
and
Vaccinium
are
dominant
(
Laumonier
et
al.
,
1983
)
.
Grasses
and
sedges
are
mostly
restricted
to
vegetation
types
found
on
disturbed
sites
,
on
freshly
exposed
sediment
and
on
newly
created
volcanic
deposits
(
Whitten
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
2.3
.
Oceanography
Sea-surface
salinities
to
the
southwest
of
Sumatra
are
lower
than
in
the
central
part
of
the
Indian
Ocean
and
display
large
variations
across
the
year
,
owing
to
heavy
seasonal
rainfalls
associated
with
the
tropical
monsoon
systems
that
prevail
over
Indonesia
.
The
monsoon
systems
also
lead
to
marked
seasonal
changes
in
current
intensity
and/or
direction
.
During
the
austral
summer
,
the
South
Java
Current
(
SJC
)
is
strengthened
by
the
northeast
Asian
Monsoon
,
and
,
consequently
,
sea-surface
salinities
are
lower
(
32
‰
)
owing
to
the
intense
monsoonal
rains
over
the
Indonesian
area
.
During
the
austral
winter
,
the
SJC
weakens
,
making
it
possible
for
a
larger
throughflow
of
water
from
the
Java
Sea
to
pass
through
the
Sunda
Strait
and
brings
more
saline
waters
(
34.2
‰
–
34.4
‰
)
as
the
monsoonal
rains
cease
in
the
Indonesian
area
.
Those
heavy
monsoonal
rainfalls
wash
much
riverborne
material
into
the
sea
,
including
pollen
,
making
marine
sedimentary
sequences
a
reliable
recorder
of
vegetation
changes
in
relation
to
the
climatic
changes
over
Sumatra
.

Material
and
methods
Deep-sea
core
BAR94-42
was
taken
from
a
water
depth
of
2542
m
at
location
6
°
04.53
′
S
and
102
°
25.09
′
E
.
The
core
is
9.8
m
in
length
and
is
fully
described
in
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
.
In
total
,
53
samples
were
analysed
for
pollen
content
at
the
Centre
for
Palynology
and
Palaeoecology
in
the
School
of
Geography
and
Environmental
Science
at
Monash
University
.
For
every
sample
,
2
ml
of
sediment
was
processed
using
the
following
method
,
adapted
from
van
der
Kaars
et

Age
control
for
core
BAR94-42
In
the
upper
part
of
the
core
(
0
–
291
cm
)
,
the
age
model
is
derived
from
seven
AMS
14
C
ages
obtained
on
mixed
surface-dwelling
planktonic
foraminifera
tests
(
Globigerinoides
ruber
,
G.
trilobus
and
G.
sacculifer
)
(
Table
1
)
.
Conversion
to
calibrated
calendar
ages
(
referred
to
here
as
kyr
)
was
performed
with
the
CALIB
5.1
beta
software
(
Stuiver
and
Reimer
,
1993
)
,
using
the
Marine04
radiocarbon
age
calibration
(
Hughen
et
al.
,
2004
)
as
well
as
assuming
a
constant
,
400
yr
reservoir
age
.
The
14
C
ages
reveal
a
sharp
decline
in
sedimentation
rate
between
~
70
and
~
95
cm
(
dated
at
~
9580
and
15,350
years
,
respectively
)
(
Fig.
4
A
and
B
)
.
Although
this
may
suggest
the
presence
of
an
hiatus
,
lasting
about
4
kyr
at
the
most
,
there
is
no
evidence
for
a
sharp
transition
in
the
sedimentology
that
supports
this
idea
.
Addressing
this
issue
will
require
additional
,
more
closely
spaced
14
C
dates
.
At
this
present
stage
,
we
prefer
to
consider
the
sedimentation
rate
over
this
depth
interval
as
continuous
and
low
,
especially
as
many
important
features
of
the
global
deglaciation
record
are
present
in
the
δ
18
O
record
of
foraminifera
from
core
BAR94-42
(
De
Deckker
and
Gingele
,
2002
and
Gingele
et
al.
,
2002
.
The
oxygen-isotope
curve
shows
its
maximum
at
17.75
kyr
BP
,
which
is
later
than
in
the
global
stratigraphy
and
does
not
correspond
,
therefore
,
to
the
Last
Glacial
Maximum
.
Interestingly
,
neighbouring
core
GeoB
10029-4
(
Mohtadi
et
al.
,
2010
)
also
shows
maximum
G.
ruber
δ
18
O
values
around
this
time
(
17.85
kyr
)
,
as
well
as
core
MD98-2165
(
~
18
ka
;
Levi
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
This
provides
further
support
for
the
reliability
of
the
14
C
chronology
proposed
for
core
BAR94-42
and
suggests
that
the
maximum
planktonic
δ
18
O
event
around
17.8
–
18
ka
is
a
genuine
,
regional
feature
.
From
depth
291
cm
to
the
base
of
the
core
,
the
age
model
is
determined
by
tuning
the
G.
ruber
δ
18
O
record
to
the
Low
Latitude
Stack
reference
curve
of
Bassinot
et
al.
(
1994
)
using
the
Analyseries
Software
(
Paillard
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
Ages
were
linearly
interpolated
between
control-points
.
The
planktonic
δ
18
O
record
of
core
BAR94-42
does
not
show
much
contrast
over
the
MIS
2
–
MIS
4
stratigraphic
interval
,
making
the
tuning
exercise
difficult
.
However
,
an
ash
layer
was
identified
in
the
interval
807
–
812
cm
,
at
the
transition
between
Marine
Isotopic
Stages
(
MIS
)
5
and
4
.
Its
stratigraphic
position
indicates
that
it
should
correspond
to
the
well-known
,
youngest
Toba
eruption
(
De
Deckker
and
Gingele
,
2002
)
.
We
use
this
age
layer
as
an
additional
control-point
,
ascribing
it
the
age
of
~
72
kyr
,
in
accordance
with
Ar/Ar
dating
of
onland
Toba
tuffs
(
73
±
4
kyr
;
Chesner
et
al.
,
1991
)
and
with
a
calendar
age
obtained
for
the
signature
of
the
Toba
eruption
in
the
GISP2
ice
record
(
71
±
5
kyr
;
Zielinski
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
This
ash
layer
tie-point
aligns
well
with
the
other
control-points
,
bringing
additional
confidence
to
our
age
model
.
This
age
model
indicates
that
the
980
cm-long
core
BAR94-42
covers
the
last
83
kyr
.
The
three
14
C
ages
obtained
in
the
interval
95
–
291
cm
and
the
δ
18
O
and
ash
layer
tie-points
in
the
lower
part
of
the
core
(
Fig.

)
,
show
that
the
sedimentation
rate
varies
smoothly
from
~
10
cm/kyr
(
in
the
lower
part
of
the
record
)
,
to
~
26
cm/kyr
(
upper
part
of
MIS
2
)
,
with
no
evidence
for
a
hiatus
in
any
part
of
the

of
the
palynological

for
individual
taxa
that
occur
more

(

lists
those

The

assemblages
show
great
diversity
in
the
taxa
represented
,
with
~
100
dryland
pollen
taxa
dominated
by
arboreal
elements
.
Pteridophyta
and
charcoal
values
are
generally
high
,
while
herbaceous
taxa
,
dominated
by
Cyperaceae
and
Poaceae
,
account
for
less
than
40
%
of
the
total
pollen
sum
.
Increases
in
the
following
taxa
are
interpreted
in
the
specific
context
of
this

as
indicators
of
greater
than

precipitation
:
Alchornea

and
Engelhardia

.
The
pollen
diagram
is
divided
into
7
zones
based
on
the
results
of
the
CONISS
routine
(
Grimm
,
1987
)
.
These
zones
will
be
discussed
in
conjunction
with
the
δ
18
O
stratigraphy/chronostratigraphy
(
see
also
Fig.
6
)
,
which
provides
the
global
climatic
framework
.
Pollen
zone
7
(
980
–
800
cm
;
~
83
–
71
kyr
)
corresponds
to
MIS
5a
.
In
this
zone
,
lowland
taxa
are
well
represented
and
include
Acacia
-
type
,
Anacardiaceae
,
Dipterocarpaceae
,
Leguminosae
,
Macaranga
-
type
,
Oleaceae
,
Rutaceae
and
Ulmus
,
as
well
as
freshwater
swampforest
taxa
Gluta
-
type
and
Nauclea
-
type
.
Lower
and
upper
montane
elements
attain
substantial
values
with
noticeable
numbers
of
Lithocarpus
-
type
,
Quercus
,
Dacrycarpus
,
Distylium
,
Engelhardia
and
Podocarpus
.
The
herbaceous
taxa
are
dominated
by
Cyperaceae
and
Poaceae
,
with
appreciable
numbers
of
Asteraceae
Tubuliflorae
and
Typha
-
type
.
Rhizophoraceae
make
up
the
majority
of
the
mangrove
taxa
,
with
a
limited
presence
of
Sonneratia
.
Pteridophyta
and
charcoal
values
are
generally
high
,
while
at
809
cm
core
depth
(
within
the
ash
layer
)
,
we
observe
the
only
and
significant
presence
of
the
freshwater
alga
Botryococcus
together
with
a
high
peak
in
lowland
and
herbaceous
taxa
and
charcoal
.
At
the
same
point
in
time
,
there
is
a
simultaneous
decrease
in
montane
taxa
and
Pteridophyta
.
A
small
but
a
noticeable
peak
in
mangrove
taxa
Rhizophoraceae
and
Sonneratia
follows
,
and
there
is
the
only
presence
in
this
zone
of
Avicennia
and
Nypa
.
The
freshwater
swampforest
and
backswamp
element
Stenochlaena
palustris
-
type
is
also
present
in
moderate
numbers
.
The
pollen
assemblages
in
zone
7
suggest
that
the
lowland
,
as
well
as
the
montane
vegetation
belts
of
southwest
Sumatra
during
MIS
5a
,
were
dominated
by
species
-
and
fern-rich
closed-canopy
rainforest
.
In
addition
,
a
substantial
presence
of
open
herbaceous
swamps
and
mangroves
occurred
along
the
coast
line
.
The
climatic
conditions
that
can
be
inferred
from
the
vegetation
reconstruction
are
annual
rainfall
and
temperatures
that
were
slightly
lower
than
today
.
There
is
little
evidence
for
increased
seasonality
in
rainfall
distribution
;
nonetheless
,
the
significant
fire
activity
suggests
that
important
droughts
occurred
regularly
.
The
sample
at
809
cm
depth
(
within
the
ash
layer
)
probably
reflects
the
in-wash
of
terrestrial
material
from
the
lowlands
and
mangroves
after
a
considerable
landslide
,
which
most
likely
was
associated
with
the
massive
Toba
eruption
.
Pollen
zone
6
(
800
–
635
cm
;
~
71
–
52
kyr
)
corresponds
to
MIS
4
and
the
earliest
part
of
MIS
3
.
The
overall
composition
of
pollen
assemblages
shows
little
change
compared
with
that
of
the
previous
zone
.
However
,
a
number
of
the
individual
taxa
do
show
some
variation
in
representation
,
for
instance
Acacia
-
type
,
Anacardiaceae
,
Dipterocarpaceae
,
Gluta
-
type
,
Oleaceae
,
Randia
,
Rutaceae
,
Ulmus
,
Typha
-
type
and
Rhizophoraceae
are
either
absent
or
are
present
in
lower
numbers
,
while
Freycinetia
-
type
,
Melanorrhoea
-
type
,
Pandanus
,
Rhamnaceae
and
Pinus
show
a
slight
increase
.
The
pollen
composition
in
zone
6
indicates
that
both
vegetation
and
climate
in
southwest
Sumatra
during
MIS
4
and
the
earliest
part
of
MIS
3
remained
similar
to
those
of
MIS
5a
.
The
rearrangement
of
taxa
may
reflect
the
regeneration
of
lowland
rainforest
after
a
period
of
disturbance
following
the
Toba
eruption
.
However
,
the
increase
in
Pinus
might
have
resulted
from
increased
influence
of
westerly
circulation
patterns
.
Today
,
natural
stands
of
Pinus
merkusii
are
confined
to
northern
Sumatra
,
with
one
isolated
stand
in
central
Sumatra
(
de
Laubenfels
,
1988
)
.
It
is
possible
then
,
that
the
presence
of
Pinus
pollen
in
low
numbers
simply
reflects
long-distance
transport
by
ocean
currents
or
by
the
NW
monsoon
because
Pinus
are
good
floaters
owing
to
their
morphology
(
Heusser
,
1978
)
.
Pollen
zone
5
(
635
–
550
cm
;
~
52
–
43
kyr
)
corresponds
to
the
earliest
part
of
MIS
3
.
It
is
characterised
by
a
marked
increase
in
Quercus
and
Poaceae
and
reduction
in
lowland
elements
such
as
Baccaurea
-
type
,
Calophyllum
,
Moraceae/Urticaceae
and
Theaceae
,
and
mangroves
.
Lowland
elements
Cunoniaceae
and
Gluta
-
type
are
absent
.
There
are
simultaneous
increases
in
lower
montane
and
herbaceous
taxa
.
The
contribution
of
upper
montane
taxa
remains
unchanged
as
do
Pteridophyta
values
and
the
amount
of
charcoal
represented
.
The
pollen
assemblages
in
zone
5
indicate
reduced
rainforest
and
cooler
,
slightly
drier
climatic
conditions
.
Vegetation
cover
most
likely
consisted
of
a
matrix
of
rainforest
with
open
herbaceous
swamps
on
poorly
drained
and
disturbed
sites
.
Montane
trees
formed
an
important
component
of
the
lowland
forest
vegetation
.
Pollen
zone
4
(
550
–
360
cm
;
~
43
–
27
kyr
)
corresponds
to
the
later
part
of
MIS
3
and
the
earliest
part
of
MIS
2
.
Lowland
taxa
levels
vary
but
remain
broadly
depressed
.
In
general
they
are
slightly
lower
than
in
the
previous
zone
.
Values
for
upper
montane
element
Dacrycarpus
are
notably
greater
than
in
the
previous
zone
,
while
Poaceae
representation
is
lower
.
Gluta
-
type
remains
absent
,
while
Nauclea
-
type
is
no
longer
present
after
40
kyr
.
This
zone
marks
the
last
occurrence
of
Nothofagus
.
Charcoal
and
Cyperaceae
representation
reduce
markedly
mid-zone
,
with
a
contemporaneous
increase
in
Pteridophyta
numbers
.
The
pollen
assemblages
recorded
in
zone
4
indicate
that
forest
cover
had
increased
gradually
,
at
the
expense
of
open
herbaceous
swamp
vegetation
,
while
the
number
of
montane
trees
in
the
lowland
forests
increased
further
.
This
indicates
that
the
later
part
of
MIS
3
continued
to
be
cooler
and
drier
than
MIS
5a
.
The
pattern
in
the
Pteridophyta
and
charcoal
curves
mid-zone
suggests
increased
river
input
and
reduced
fire
activity
during
the
transition
to
MIS
2
when
considerably
more
humid
climatic
conditions
appear
to
have
developed
.
Alternatively
,
the
intensity
and
frequency
of
droughts
may
have
reduced
to
such
an
extent
that
they
had
little
environmental
impact
.
Under
the
latter
scenario
,
temperatures
may
have
been
slightly
reduced
causing
a
gradual
increase
in
humidity
.
The
disappearance
of
the
New
Guinean
taxon
Nothofagus
by
40
kyr
,
the
presence
of
which
is
a
result
of
long-distance
transport
by
either
wind
or
water
,
indicates
reduced
influence
of
easterly
wind
or
ocean
current
circulation
patterns
.
Pollen
zone
3
(
360
–
140
cm
;
~
27
kyr
–
17
kyr
)
corresponds
to
MIS
2
.
It
encompasses
the
LGM
(
~
23
–
19
kyr
)
and
a
narrow
interval
of
high
δ
18
O
values
(
153
–
147
cm
;
~
17.75
–
17.5
kyr
)
.
The
most
noticeable
feature
of
pollen
zone
3
is
the
striking
increase
in
Pteridophyta
numbers
;
up
to
4
times
higher
than
in
the
previous
zones
.
Other
characteristics
include
increases
in
Acalypha
-
type
,
Calophyllum
,
Nauclea
-
type
,
Sapotaceae/Meliaceae
and
Theaceae
and
decreases
in
Macaranga
-
type
,
Cyperaceae
and
Poaceae
,
with
declining
Dipterocarpaceae
numbers
in
the
upper
part
of
this
zone
.
The
vegetation
cover
remained
largely
unchanged
from
the
previous
period
.
However
,
the
decline
in
open
herbaceous
swamp
cover
continued
,
while
the
contribution
of
montane
trees
to
the
lowland
forest
vegetation
attained
the
highest
levels
overall
during
this
period
.
The
decline
in
dipterocarp
numbers
in
the
upper
part
of
zone
3
reflects
reduced
temperatures
during
MIS
2
.
The
increase
in
montane
elements
and
decline
in
herbaceous
taxa
are
in
agreement
with
this
trend
.
While
it
might
be
logical
to
ascribe
the
massive
increase
in
Pteridophyta
numbers
to
increased
riverine
input
and
,
consequently
,
increased
precipitation
,
the
pollen
assemblages
,
however
,
indicate
only
gradual
changes
to
more
humid
conditions
throughout
this
period
and
suggest
that
alternative
possibilities
should
be
explored
.
In
many
marine
cores
from
this
region
,
concurrent
changes
have
been
observed
between
the
δ
18
O
record
and
Pteridophyta
curves
produced
for
the
same
cores
(
e.g.
Morley
et
al.
,
2004
,
van
der
Kaars
et
al.
,
2000
and
van
der
Kaars
,
1991
)
.
In
the
BAR94-42
record
,
however
,
the
pattern
appears
to
be
the
reverse
;
highest
Pteridophyta
values
occur
during
MIS
2
rather
than
the
Holocene
(
Fig.
6
)
.
One
explanation
might
stem
from
the
significantly
different
land
–
sea
distribution
within
the
archipelago
at
this
time
;
the
lowered
sea
level
created
a
long
and
narrow
embayment
parallel
to
the
coast
of
southwest
Sumatra
that
would
have
channelled
riverine
input
,
including
Pteridophyta
spores
,
close
to
the
BAR94-42
core
site
(
Fig.
7
)
.
Some
support
for
this
hypothesis
is
provided
by
the
generally
much
higher
influx
values
of
the
Pteridophyta
as
well
as
the
charcoal
and
dryland
influx
values
from
83
to
~
17
kyr
than
in
the
period
from
17
kyr
to
the
present
.
The
high
values
for
these
elements
indicate
that
runoff
,
and
therefore
precipitation
,
in
the
hinterland
along
the
southwest
coast
of
Sumatra
was
substantial
during
the
glacial
.
Pollen
zone
2
(
140
–
80

;
17

corresponds
to
the

deglaciation
(
Termination

)
.
Regular
changes
are
observed
in
the
representation
of
lowland
,
upper
and
lower
montane
,
herbaceous
taxa
and
Pteridophyta
.
Lowland
elements
such
as
Baccaurea
-
type
,
Dipterocapaceae
and
Macaranga
-
type
all
resurge
,
while
values
for
all
montane
elements
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
Engelhardia
,
are
suppressed
.
Pinus
is
no
longer
present
.
Rhizophoraceae
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
Stenochlaena
palustris
-
type
,
increase
,
while
montane
and
herbaceous
taxa
,
and
Pteridophyta
are
generally
lower
.
The
significant
reduction
in
montane
taxa
occupying
the
lowland
belt
,
and
in
the
area
covered
by
open
herbaceous
swamps
determined
from
the
pollen
signal
recorded
in
zone
2
,
reflects
the
onset
of
warmer
and
wetter
climatic
conditions
very
similar
to
those
of
today
,
possibly
with
a
brief
reversal
at
mid-transition
.
Mangroves
and
backswamps
become
established
as
sea
level
rises
and
river
valleys
come
under
tidal
influence
.
Pollen
zone
1
(
80
–
0
cm
;
~
11.9
–
1.8
kyr
)
corresponds
to
the
Holocene
(
MIS
1
)
.
There
is
a
further
increase
in
lowland
elements
including
,
Alchornea
-
type
,
Glochidion
,
Gluta
-
type
,
Macaranga
-
type
and
Palmae
Oncosperma
-
type
as
upper
and
lower
montane
taxa
decrease
in
representation
.
Rhizophoraceae
numbers
peak
at
the
base
of
this
zone
and
Cyperaceae
and
,
especially
,
Poaceae
numbers
decline
greatly
.
Charcoal
reduces
and
Pteridophyta
resurge
after
the
low
values
in
the
previous
zone
.
The
changes
in
taxa
represented
in
zone
1
indicate
that
the
Holocene
expansion
of
lowland
closed-canopy
rainforest
includes
freshwater
swamp
forest
and
,
together
with
further
reductions
in
fire
activity
,
indicates
the
establishment
of
today
's
perhumid
climatic
conditions
wherein
low
intensity
,
low
frequency
droughts
occur
that
have
little
environmental
impact

Implications
of
the
new
chronology
for
the
BAR94-42
biogenic
and
terrigeneous
records
of
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
The
recent
addition
of
seven
AMS
-
14
C
ages
has
substantially
refined
the
chronology
proposed
for
core
BAR94-42
,
making
it
necessary
to
re-ascribe
ages
to
events
seen
in
the
earlier
study
of
this
core
by
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
.
A
number
of
their
original
data
sets
are
presented
in
Fig.
6
showing
the
original
chronology
for
the
core
as
well
as
the
revised
one
.
A
brief
description
of
the
new
event
chronology
and
the
implications
for
the
interpretation
of
the
biogenic
and
terrigeneous
data
sets
is
given
here
prior
to
incorporating
the
revised
results
into
the
general
discussion
in
Section
7
.
6.1
.
Biogenic
proxies
Bulk
biogenic
carbonate
percentage
values
are
high
from
the
base
of
the
record
until
~
61
kyr
,
with
a
minimum
around
72
kyr
and
a
maximum
from
82
–
80
kyr
.
From
~
61
–
52
kyr
values
are
low
and
from
52
–
33
kyr
are
moderate
followed
by
a
gentle
decline
until
a
well-defined
minimum
from
23
–
17
ka
and
a
pronounced
maximum
from
17
–
11
kyr
.
From
11
ka
to
the
top
of
the
record
,
the
bulk
carbonate
percentage
values
are
generally
below
average
.
The
giant
diatom
Ethmodiscus
rex
is
present
from
82
–
17
kyr
with
a
distinct
maximum
shown
from
23
–
17
ka
.
It
is
clear
that
,
using
the
age
model
proposed
here
,
the
highest
peaks
of
E.
rex
now
coincide
with
the
LGM
.
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
proposed
that
reduced
ocean
circulation
and
increased
stratification
in
the
water
column
during
the
last
glacial
period
may
have
trapped
nutrients
in
deeper
water
masses
,
especially
in
the
period
23
–
17
kyr
,
where
they
were
utilised
by
E.
rex
.
They
also
suggest
that
from
17
ka
onwards
,
conditions
were
more
turbid
,
perhaps
resulting
from
stronger
glacial
winds
,
which
reached
maximum
strength
in
mid-MIS
2
and
that
may
have
recirculated
nutrients
to
the
surface
,
leading
to
increased
nanoplankton
productivity
and
zooplankton
(
foraminifera
)
abundance
,
as
well
as
carbonate
preservation
.
The
interpretations
of
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
fit
the
newly
proposed
chronology
very
well
.
6.2
.
Terrigeneous
proxies
For
most
of
their
record
,
kaolinite
values
average
~
20
%
.
It
is
only
during
the
periods
from
83
–
71
kyr
,
after
16
ka
and
,
especially
,
immediately
after
10
kyr
,
that
higher
values
occur
.
According
to
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
,
this
pattern
largely
reflects
the
input
of
water
from
the
Java
Sea
through
the
Sunda
Strait
during
periods
of
high
global
sea
level
.
Today
,
maximum
kaolinite
values
occur
in
the
Sunda
Strait
(
Gingele
et
al.
,
2001
)
and
it
is
possible
that
clay
minerals
are
transported
to
the
BAR94-42
site
when
the
SJC
flows
westward
during
the
SE
monsoon
.
Patterns
displayed
by
the
other
clay
mineral
curves
are
more
complex
.
Smectite
percentages
are
high
at
83
ka
,
below
average
until
75
kyr
,
rise
again
from
75
–
63
kyr
,
then
present
a
distinct
minimum
from
63
–
37
kyr
.
From
37
kyr
to
the
top
of
the
record
,
values
hover
around
25
–
30
%
,
with
the
exception
of
a
distinct
maximum
from
17
–
10
kyr
.
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
identify
the
most
likely
source
area
for
smectite
is
to
the
east
of
the
core
site
and
propose
that
smectite
peaks
reflect
periods
with
a
strong
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
,
caused
by
intensification
of
southeasterly
winds
during
the
austral
winter
monsoon
.
The
pattern
shown
in
the
illite
curve
is
,
largely
,
the
reverse
of
the
smectite
curve
.
A
minimum
at
83
kyr
is
followed
by
above
average
values
until
75
kyr
and
low
values
from
75
to
63
kyr
.
There
is
a
distinct
maximum
from
63
–
37
kyr
then
values
vary
from
25
–
35
%
during
the
period
37
–
17
kyr
.
After
17
kyr
,
and
especially
after
13
kyr
,
illite
percentages
are
mainly
below
25
.
Gingele
et
al.
(
2001
)
consider
the
northern
tip
of
Sumatra
to
be
the
main
supply
source
of
illite
to
the
core
site
.
They
propose
that
high
illite
values
reflect
increased
intensity
of
the
eastward
flow
of
the
SJC
driven
by
stronger
NW
winds
during
the
austral
summer
monsoon
.
Chlorite
values
are
constant
throughout
the
record
,
fluctuating
from
17
–
22
%
.
Gingele
et
al.
,
2001
report
that
the
distribution
of
chlorite
along
the
Indonesian
islands
is
uniform
and
,
as
a
result
,
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
consider
downcore
variations
in
chlorite
values
unlikely
to
be
affected
by
changes
in
ocean
currents
.
Instead
,
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
concluded
that
relatively
high
fluvial
runoff
and
,
therefore
,
precipitation
,
must
have
occurred
during
the
glacial
in
order
to
deliver
chlorite
to
the
BAR94
–
42
site
.
The
quartz/feldspar
ratio
is
around
2
for
much
of
the
record
,
however
,
high
values
occur
from
83
–
71
kyr
,
after
16
kyr
and
,
especially
,
after
7
kyr
.
This
pattern
largely
follows
the
kaolinite
record
and
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
propose
the
Sunda
Strait
to
be
most
likely
source
area
.

Discussion
addressing
palaeoclimatic
reconstructions
and
regional
palaeoceanographic
and
palaeoenvironmental
patterns
7.1
.
Reconstruction
of
palaeoclimatic
and
palaeoceanographic
conditions
from
core
BAR94-42
and
adjacent
marine
records
The
BAR94-42
kaolinite
and
quartz/feldspar
records
indicate
that
there
were
influxes
of
Java
Sea
water
and
a
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
driven
by
a
SE
monsoon
in
the
period
spanning
~
83
–
~
75
kyr
.
However
,
the
smectite
and
illite
records
show
that
the
SJC
flow
could
have
varied
and
that
the
eastward
flow
could
have
been
more
moderate
than
at
present
.
These
findings
are
in
agreement
with
conclusions
from
study
of
core
SO139-74KL
,
taken
to
the
east
of
core
BAR94-42
,
by
Lückge
et
al.
(
2009
)
(
Fig.
1
)
.
The
SO139-74KL
palaeoproductivity
record
,
based
on
total
organic
carbon
(
TOC
)
content
,
chlorine
and
alkenone
concentrations
,
identifies
the
periods
from
~
85
–
~
75
kyr
and
the
Holocene
as
the
two
phases
of
highest
productivity
and
,
by
inference
,
strengthened
SE
monsoonal
winds
(
Lückge
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
The
authors
suggested
that
a
strong
link
exists
between
seasonal
upwelling
off
Sumatra
and
Java
and
the
SE
monsoon
intensity
.
They
argued
that
,
in
the
past
,
SE
monsoonal
winds
were
strengthened
during
Northern
Hemisphere
insolation
maxima
,
resulting
in
increased
upwelling
and
productivity
.
During
the
bulk
of
the
glacial
period
,
from
~
75
kyr
to
the
onset
of
the
Holocene
,
the
predominance
of
rainforest
taxa
in
the
BAR94-42
record
indicates
the
climate
was
humid
,
with
annual
precipitation
of
more
than
2000
mm
,
the
chlorite
and
Pteridophyta
curves
indicate
that
precipitation
and
runoff
remained
substantial
and
possibly
,
as
indicated
by
the
gradual
increase
in
herb
values
,
a
short
dry
season
developed
.
It
is
likely
that
the
dry
season
occurred
during
the
SE
monsoon
and
that
it
only
lasted
one
to
two
months
.
The
BAR94-42
illite
record
suggests
that
,
from
~
75
–
~
63
kyr
,
the
eastward
flow
of
the
SJC
had
reduced
,
possibly
driven
by
a
weaker
NW
monsoon
.
The
BAR94-42
smectite
record
shows
that
the
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
and
SE
monsoon
were
strong
.
The
palaeoproductivity
proxies
from
core
SO139-74KL
also
indicate
that
the
NW
component
of
the
monsoon
weakened
and
the
SE
component
dominated
monsoonal
circulation
(
Lückge
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
During
this
time
,
increased
charcoal
and
herbs
suggest
that
the
dry
season
may
have
increased
to
two
months
.
The
chlorite
and
Pteridophyta
records
,
together
with
increased
rainforest
,
show
that
precipitation
and
runoff
remained
high
.
In
the
period
~
63
–
~
37
kyr
,
the
BAR94-42
illite
record
indicates
an
increase
in
the
eastward
flow
of
the
SJC
under
stronger
NW
winds
during
the
austral
summer
monsoon
.
Effective
eastward
transport
is
supported
by
the
presence
of
long-distance
transported
Pinus
merkusii
pollen
during
this
period
.
The
minimum
in
the
smectite
record
at
~
55
kyr
might
point
to
a
reduction
of
the
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
and
a
weaker
SE
monsoon
.
These
findings
are
generally
consistent
with
the
palaeoproductivity
proxy
record
from
core
SO139-74KL
(
Lückge
et
al.
,
2009
)
,
indicating
a
dominance
of
the
NW
monsoon
for
most
of
this
period
,
but
a
swing
to
SE
monsoon
activity
at
~
55
kyr
,
is
suggested
by
the
SO139-74KL
TOC
record
.
For
the
period
~
52
–
43
kyr
,
there
is
relatively
little
change
in
the
BAR94-42
palynological
data
;
charcoal
levels
are
high
and
herbs
reach
their
maximum
values
here
for
the
entire
record
.
These
patterns
identify
this
period
as
the
driest
phase
of
the
last
83,000
years
composed
of
a
humid
monsoonal
climate
,
with
a
dry
season
of
two
months
.
The
chlorite
and
Pteridophyta
data
support
this
idea
of
high
precipitation
and
runoff
throughout
this
time
.
For
the
period
from
~
37
–
~
27
kyr
,
reduction
in
the
eastward
flow
of
the
SJC
and
weaker
NW
winds
are
indicated
by
the
BAR94-42
illite
record
,
however
,
the
sustained
presence
of
Pinus
merkusii
pollen
shows
that
eastward
transport
remained
effective
.
Strengthening
of
the
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
and
the
SE
monsoon
is
indicated
by
the
BAR94-42
smectite
record
.
This
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
record
of
palaeoproductivity
from
core
SO139-74Kl
.
Lower
charcoal
values
and
a
gradual
reduction
in
herb
representation
suggest
a
gradual
decline
in
the
duration
of
the
dry
season
,
while
the
chlorite
and
Pteridophyta
records
point
to
high
runoff
and
precipitation
.
These
trends
continue
in
the
period
from
~
27
–
17
kyr
.
Further
reduction
in
the
length
of
the
dry
season
is
suggested
by
lower
herb
numbers
,
while
substantial
precipitation
and
runoff
are
indicated
by
significantly
elevated
Pteridophyta
levels
,
as
well
as
little
carbonate
.
The
Pteridophyta
peak
coincides
with
a
peak
in
Ethmodiscus
rex
abundance
,
although
it
is
not
clear
if
there
is
a
causal
link
between
these
two
proxies
or
if
they
are
controlled
by
the
same
forcing
mechanism
.
There
is
,
however
,
evidence
for
a
link
between
deep
and
intermediate
ocean
circulation
,
nutrient
and
stratification
of
the
water
column
,
and
the
patterns
observed
in
the
carbonate
and
E.
rex
records
noted
by
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
are
also
displayed
in
nearby
core
BAR94-03
(
Murgese
et
al.
,
2008
;
Fig.

)
.
In
their
study
of
changes
dealing
with
the
foraminifera
and
dinoflagellate
cyst
content
during
the
last
35,000
years
,
Murgese
et
al.
(
2008
)
conclude
that
,
from
35
–
~
14.4
kyr
,
the
water
column
was
stratified
and
nutrient
levels
in
the
surface
and
sub-surface
waters
were
very
low
,
resulting
in
low
primary
productivity
.
However
,
for
the
period
from
~
25
–
~
14.4
kyr
,
the
benthic
foraminifera
record
indicates
increased
food
supply
to
the
sea
floor
.
This
period
of
augmented
nutrient
levels
in
deeper
water
broadly
coincides
with
that
inferred
from
heightened
E.
rex
abundance
values
by
Gingele
et
al.
(
2002
)
.
The
BAR94-42
illite
,
smectite
and
Pinus
merkusii
records
indicate
increased
eastward
flow
of
the
SJC
and
a
strengthening
of
NW
monsoon
with
a
largely
unaltered
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
and
SE
monsoon
.
There
was
high
rainfall
and
a
dry
season
of
about
a
month
.
Support
for
the
idea
that
there
was
a
moderate
increase
in
the
strength
of
the
NW
Monsoon
and
low
surface
water
productivity
from
~
27
–
17
kyr
,
comes
from
the
SO139-74KL
palaeoproductivity
record
(
Lückge
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
The
lengthy
duration
of
coldest
climatic
conditions
in
the
BAR94-42
record
,
from
~
52
–
~
17
kyr
is
worthy
of
specific
mention
.
In
the
Bandung
Basin
record
(
van
der
Kaars
,
1998
,
van
der
Kaars
and
Dam
,
1995
and
van
der
Kaars
and
Dam
,
1997
)
,
the
only
other
record
from
the
west
of
the
archipelago
that
covers
this
time
period
,
the
duration
of
coldest
conditions
,
indicated
by
maximum
expansion
of
montane
trees
,
lasts
a
similarly
long
time
;
commencing
at
~
47
kyr
and
lasting
until
20
–
16
kyr
.
The
relationship
between
increased
δ
18
O
values
and
decreased
representation
of
lowland
trees
in
the
BAR94-42
record
is
also
particularly
noteworthy
and
suggests
that
the
extent
of
lowland
trees
is
largely
controlled
by
temperature
.
This
is
amply
demonstrated
during
the
short
period
of
high
δ
18
O
values
from
17.75
–
17.5
kyr
,
at
the
boundary
between
pollen
zones
3
and
2
,
that
is
characterised
by
a
sharp
decrease
in
numbers
of
lowland
trees
and
increased
representation
of
montane
trees
.
These
findings
demonstrate
that
millennial-scale
variations
in
temperature
may
impact
on
the
composition
of
the
lowland
forests
of
southwest
Sumatra
.
Changes
seen
after
17
kyr
include
a
major
reorganisation
of
oceanographic
and
atmospheric
circulation
patterns
;
E.
rex
and
P.
merkusii
are
no
longer
present
and
together
with
the
illite
record
,
all
suggest
that
the
intensity
of
the
eastward
flow
of
the
SJC
was
reduced
.
Peaks
in
carbonate
and
smectite
that
occurred
from
17
–
10
kyr
suggest
less
river
discharge
and
strong
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
during
the
SE
monsoon
,
respectively
.
The
palaeoproductivity
record
from
nearby
core
SO139-74KL
established
by
Lückge
et
al.
(
2009
)
suggests
that
the
SE
monsoonal
circulation
strengthened
from
~
17
kyr
onwards
.
Re-establishment
of
the
influx
of
Java
Sea
water
after
~
11
kyr
is
indicated
by
the
BAR94-42
kaolinite
and
quartz/feldspar
records
and
reductions
in
Pteridophyta
,
herb
and
charcoal
values
and
increased
representation
of
lowland
rainforest
indicate
that
climate
had
become
everwet
,
i.e.
without
a
dry
season
,
by
10
kyr
.
These
findings
are
in
accordance
with
the
foraminifera
and
dinoflagellate
records
from
core
BAR94-03
produced
by
Murgese
et
al.
(
2008
)
in
which
increased
monsoonal
activity
during
the
early
Holocene
(
specifically
,
after
~
11.4
kyr
)
,
is
indicated
,
and
resulted
in
increased
precipitation
,
river
runoff
,
sediment
discharge
and
offshore
sediment
transport
from
the
continental
shelf
.

Comparison
of
existing
(
and
emerging
)
pollen
records
from
West
Java
and
Sumatra
with
the
new
pollen
record
from
core
BAR94-42
Two
lowland
records
from
West
Java
provide
a
clear
picture
of
the
nature
of
the
vegetation
during
the
last
glacial
that
allows
us
to
consider
the
relationship
between
the
degree
of
openness
in
glacial
vegetation
and
the
present-day
amount
of
annual
precipitation
.
In
the
east
,
the
record
from
the
Bandung
Basin
shows
changes
in
the
herbaceous
–
arboreal
pollen
ratio
from
20:80
during
the
last
interglacial
to
90:10
during
the
last
glacial
period
(
van
der
Kaars
,
1998
,
van
der
Kaars
and
Dam
,
1995
and
van
der
Kaars
and

,
1997
)
.
Further
to
the
west
,
the
Rawa
Danau
record
the
herbaceous
–
arboreal
ratio
changes
from
80:20
in
the
last
glacial
period
to
10:90
during
the
Holocene
.
In
addition
to
these
significant
changes
in
the
degree
of
openess
,
other
evidence
for
drier
climates
comes
from
elevated
charcoal
levels
and
strongly
reduced
Pteridophyta
values
(
van
der
Kaars
et
al.
,
2001a
,
van
der
Kaars
et
al.
,
2001b
and
Turney
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
In
contrast
,
the
highland
site
at
Situ
Bayongbong
maintains
an
herbaceous
–
arboreal
ratio
of
10:90
during
the
last
glacial
period
(
Stuijts
,
1984
and
Stuijts
,
1993
)
.
On
Sumatra
,
only
records
from
highland
sites
are
yet
available
.
The
Danau
di
Atas
record
from
central
Sumatra
,
herbaceous
taxa
are
dominated
by
Cyperaceae
and
Poaceae
,
in
varying
proportions
throughout
the
last
35
kyr
,
however
,
the
record
lacks
a
clear
glacial
–
interglacial
turnover
pattern
(
Newsome
and
Flenley
,
1988
and
Stuijts
et
al.
,
1988
)
.
The
herbaceous
–
arboreal
ratio
remains
broadly
around
25:75
throughout
the
last
35
kyr
.
The
Pea
Sim-sim
record
from
north
Sumatra
shows
only
slight
change
in
the
herbaceous
–
arboreal
ratio
;
during
the
last
glacial
,
the
values
are
10:90
shifting
to
5:95
in
the
Holocene
(
Maloney
,
1980
and
Maloney
,
1985
)
.
In
contrast
to
many
other
marine
pollen
records
from
the
region
(
e.g.
Morley
et
al.
,
2004
,
van
der
Kaars
et
al.
,
2000
and
van
der
Kaars
,
1991
)
,
the
maximum
representation
of
herbaceous
taxa
in
core
BAR94-42
does
not
occur
during
MIS
2
but
in
the
period
between
50
and
45
kyr
,
demonstrating
that
there
is
no
direct
link
between
maximum
global
aridity
and
the
extent
of
herbaceous
taxa
in
this
record
.
In
the
BAR94-42
record
,
the
difference
between
the
ratio
of
40:60
herbaceous
–
arboreal
recorded
in
the
period
from
52
–
43
kyr
and
the
ratio
of
10:90
in
the
Holocene
is
clearly
not
as
extreme
as
the
changes
in
openness
seen
in
the
records
from
West
Java
.
That
the
site
maintains
a
high
proportion
of
forest
indicates
that
rainfall
remained
higher
and
changes
in
inter-annual
variability
were
less
extreme
at
this
location
.
These
conditions
indicate
that
the
monsoon
remained
active
throughout
MIS
3
.
After
~
43
kyr
,
the
gradual
reduction
in
openness
and
fewer
represented
Pteridophyta
indicate
that
an
everwet
climate
developed
,
likely
in
response
to
intensified
monsoonal
circulation
.
An
emerging
record
from
study
of
core
GeoB
10029-4
,
located
some
500
km
to
the
north
of
the
BAR94-42
core
site
(
Fig.
7
)
(
van
der
Kaars
,
unpublished
data
)
,
indicates
that
,
on
central
Sumatra
,
little
change
in
the
herbaceous
–
arboreal
ratio
occurred
over
the
last
18
kyr
,
values
instead
remained
stable
at
around
5:95
(
Fig.
8
)
(
van
der
Kaars
,
unpublished
data
)
.
This
suggests
that
rainforest
cover
in
central
Sumatra
remained
and
highlights
the
fact
that
BAR94-42
is
located
in
a
boundary
position
.
Moreover
,
the
patterns
of
Pterophyta
representation
in
the
GeoB
10029-4
sequence
are
comparable
to
the
high
percentage
and
influx
values
recorded
in
the
BAR94-42
core
during
MIS
2
(
Fig.
8
)
(
van
der
Kaars
,
unpublished
data
)
,
providing
support
for
our
interpretation
that
rainfall
and
runoff
levels
during
that
period
were
as
high
as
they
are
today
.
From
the
comparison
of
these
records
,
it
is
possible
to
deduce
that
forest
cover
was
maintained
during
glacial
periods
at
sites
that
,
under
present
climate
conditions
,
have
high
and
equably
distributed
rainfall
and
little
inter-annual
variability
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
.
In
contrast
,
it
appears
that
at
sites
where
precipitation
is
already
more
seasonal
and
precipitation
variability
is
higher
today
,
forest
cover
was
reduced
during
the
glacial
period
.
The
seasonality
and
variability
in
present-day
rainfall
in
the
Bandung
Basin
and
Rawa
Danau
appear
to
explain
,
in
part
,
the
susceptibility
of
forest
to
reduced
rainfall
and
increased
variability
during
the
glacial
.
The
lesser
seasonality
and
lesser
variability
at
Pea
Sim-sim
and
Danau
di
Atas
today
may
partly
explain
why
these
site
experienced
lesser
extremes
in
the
past
and
maintained
more
forest
during
the
last
glacial
.
In
addition
,
in
contrast
to
eastern
Sumatra
and
Java
,
rainfall
in
western
Sumatra
is
not
strongly
influenced
by
ENSO
or
by
local
SST
(
Aldrian
and
Susanto
,
2003
)

Conclusions
Major
changes
in
vegetation
,
monsoonal
circulation
and
oceanographic
conditions
have
been
identified
through
our
study
of
core
BAR94-42
from
offshore
southwest
Sumatra
(
summarised
in
Fig.
9
)
.
During
MIS
5a
,
the
vegetation
of
southwest
Sumatra
was
covered
by
rainforest
,
with
open
herbaceous
swamps
lining
river
courses
and
surrounding
lakes
.
The
monsoonal
circulation
was
dominated
by
the
SE
monsoon
component
but
NW
winds
remained
an
active
part
of
the
climate
system
.
Rainfall
levels
exceeded
2000
mm
per
year
and
there
was
a
short
dry
season
and
temperatures
were
lower
than
today
.
The
input
of
water
from
the
Java
Sea
through
the
Sunda
Strait
was
persistent
during
MIS
5a
and
the
SJC
flowed
westward
in
the
austral
winter
and
were
driven
by
the
SE
monsoon
.
During
MIS
4
,
the
extent
of
open
herbaceous
swamps
increased
as
did
fire
activity
.
Both
the
NW
and
SE
components
of
the
monsoon
were
active
.
Climatic
conditions
were
comparable
with
those
in
MIS
5a
,
but
the
length
and
intensity
of
the
dry
season
likely
increased
.
Input
of
water
from
the
Java
Sea
gradually
ceased
as
global
sea
level
fell
,
exposing
the
Sunda
Shelf
and
Sunda
Strait
.
Productivity
in
surface
waters
was
generally
low
.
MIS
3
was
composed
of
three
distinct
phases
;
from
~
59
to
52
kyr
,
the
extent
of
open
herbaceous
swamps
reduced
,
there
was
less
fire
activity
and
increased
river
runoff
.
Climatic
conditions
became
more
humid
after
MIS
4
and
the
NW
component
of
the
monsoon
became
dominant
.
From
~
52
to
43
kyr
,
open
herbaceous
swamps
expanded
to
reach
a
maximum
extent
;
representation
of
montane
rainforest
increased
,
regular
fires
returned
and
river
runoff
declined
,
identifying
this
phase
as
the
driest
period
of
the
record
and
the
onset
of
coldest
conditions
.
Monsoonal
patterns
remained
largely
unchanged
.
From
~
43
kyr
until
the
end
of
MIS
3
,
the
amount
of
open
herbaceous
swamp
area
declined
and
,
from
about
35
kyr
,
fires
became
more
infrequent
and
Pteridophyta
numbers
increased
.
After
33
kyr
,
river
runoff
increased
,
the
SE
component
of
the
monsoon
and
the
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
became
stronger
.
More
humid
conditions
developed
and
the
duration
and
intensity
of
the
dry
season
reduced
.
High
values
for
montane
tree
indicate
cool
climatic
conditions
.
Montane
trees
and
very
high
numbers
of
Pteridophyta
persisted
for
most
of
MIS
2
indicating
that
cold
conditions
continued
.
It
is
mooted
that
lowered
sea
level
created
a
long
and
narrow
embayment
parallel
to
the
coast
of
southwest
Sumatra
that
channelled
riverine
input
,
including
Pteridophyta
spores
,
close
to
the
BAR94-42
core
site
.
Precipitation
,
in
the
hinterland
along
the
southwest
coast
of
Sumatra
was
substantial
during
the
glacial
.
The
MIS
2
–
1
transition
was
a
time
of
major
environmental
upheaval
and
a
reorganisation
of
oceanographic
and
atmospheric
circulation
patterns
.
During
the
transition
E.
rex
populations
collapsed
,
Pteridophyta
,
charcoal
and
pollen
influx
declined
and
mangroves
marked
the
rise
of
sea
level
.
During
the
Holocene
,
southwest
Sumatra
was
covered
again
by
tropical
,
everwet
rainforest
;
comprised
of
lowland
taxa
and
fewer
montane
trees
.
Increased
monsoonal
activity
resulted
in
increased
precipitation
,
river
runoff
,
sediment
discharge
and
offshore
sediment
transport
from
the
continental
shelf
.
Influx
of
Java
Sea
water
through
the
Sunda
Strait
resumed
and
strong
westward
flow
of
the
SJC
was
driven
by
a
reinvigorated
SE
monsoon
resulting
in
increased
upwelling
and
productivity
.
In
addition
to
the
specific
record
of
palaeoenvironments
summarised
above
,
comparison
of
the
BAR94-42
record
with
existing
records
contributes
to
assessment
of
the
spatial
extent
of
everwet
rainforest
during
the
last
glacial
.
It
is
clear
from
our
results
that
,
despite
the
presence
of
extensive
open
herbaceous
swamps
in
southwest
Sumatra
during
the
last
glacial
,
large
tracts
of
tropical
rainforest
remained
.
It
is
also
clear
that
Pteridophyta
comprised
a
large
part
of
the
glacial
vegetation
assemblages
.
These
findings
suggest
that
a
mosaic
of
closed
canopied
rainforests
and
herbaceous
swamps
must
have
existed
,
in
strong
contrast
with
reconstructions
made
for
the
lowlands
of
West
Java
,
that
indicate
that
residual
pockets
of
rainforest
existed
in
a
matrix
of
open
herbaceous
swamps
.
The
role
of
Pteridophyta
in
the
West
Java
assemblages
was
lesser
than
that
on
Sumatra
and
fire
activity
was
much
greater
.
Comparison
of
our
results
with
reconstructions
from
the
highlands
of
northern
and
central
Sumatra
indicates
that
southwest
Sumatra
was
on
the
margin
of
the
everwet
core
during
the
period
from
~
83
–
12
kyr
.
This
finding
further
augments
the
observations
made
by
Kershaw
et
al.
,
2001
and
Kershaw
et
al.
,
2007
that
the
glacial
vegetation
of
Indonesia
was
far
from
uniform
,
and
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
sensitivity
of
sites
to
changes
in
precipitation
,
e.g.
between
highland
and
lowland
sites
,
must
be
considered
when
assembling
regional
vegetation
reconstructions
for
the
Malay
Archipelago
.
Consequently
,
we
caution
against
regional
generalisations
made
without
consideration
of
local
factors
,
such
as
site
location
and
local
topography
(
e.g.
Visser
et
al.
,
2004
)
;
these
merely
lead
to
erroneous
rejection
of
robust
