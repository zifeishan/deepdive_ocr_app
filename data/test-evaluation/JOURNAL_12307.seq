's
role
in
the
distribution
of
the
Cretaceous
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
throughout
Gondwana
Abstract
A
high
diversity
of
terrestrial
crocodyliform
species
has
been
found
in
the
continental
Cretaceous
deposits
of
Gondwana
.
They
are
widespread
in
the
sedimentary
basins
of
Brazil
,
Uruguay
,
Argentina
,
Bolivia
,
Morocco
,
Cameroon
,
Niger
,
Malawi
,
Madagascar
and
Pakistan
,
from
alluvial
,
fluvial
and
lacustrine
deposits
.
A
peculiar
aspect
of
these
terrestrial
crocodyliforms
is
that
only
some
of
them
are
cosmopolitan
.
They
comprise
distinct
groups
as
the
basal
Notosuchia
,
baurusuchids
,
sphagesaurids
and
Sebecian
peirosaurids
.
There
is
a
distribution
pattern
of
the
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
faunas
throughout
the
Cretaceous
.
The
oldest
are
composed
of
the
small
and
probably
omnivorous
Notosuchia
and
Araripesuchus
,
found
in
Early
Cretaceous
deposits
.
In
the
Late
Cretaceous
this
fauna
was
enriched
by
the
medium-sized
to
large-size
baurusuchids
,
sphagesaurids
,
peirosaurids
and
larger
Araripesuchus
which
present
specializations
as
active
terrestrial
predators
.
The
distribution
analysis
of
the
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
from
Early
and
Late
Cretaceous
palaeogeographic
and
palaeoclimatic
maps
indicates
that
temperature
was
the
principal
influence
on
their
Gondwanan
distribution
.
Although
expressed
seasonality
,
aridity
is
a
limiting
factor
for
the
distribution
of
extant
crocodilians
.
The
Cretaceous
basal
Notosuchia
,
baurusuchids
,
sphagesaurids
,
Araripesuchus
,
Sebecian
peirosaurids
,
are
found
in
arid
climatic
belts
during
Early
and
Late
Cretaceous
.
To
live
in
a
hot
and
arid
climate
they
have
presumably
developed
ecological
strategies
that
allowed
such
habits
.
The
aridity
or
seasonal
warm
and
cyclic
dry
and
wet
climate
periods
plays
a
role
,
that
have
not
yet
been
analyzed
,
that
may
explain
the

of
bizarre
Crocodyliformes
in

Introduction
The
terrestrial
Cretaceous
Crocodyliformes
from
Gondwana
comprises
distinct
groups
as
the
small
basal
Notosuchia
,
baurusuchids
,
sphagesaurids
,
Araripesuchus
and
peirosaurids
.
The
oldest
ones
are
probably
Berriasian
(
Uiraúna
Basin
,
Brazil
)
,
despite
which
their
diversification
took
place
during
Aptian-Albian
in
South
America
and
Africa
.
They
are
widespread
in
deposits
of
alluvial
,
fluvial
and
lake
paleoenvironments
,
comprising
more
than
30
species
(
Fig.
1
,
Fig.
2
,
Fig.
3
and
Fig.
4
)
.
The
taxonomic
and
systematic
definitions
are
based
on
Sereno
and
Larsson
(
2009
)
.
Their
systematic
revision
infers
that
the
Notosuchian
clade
groups
Baurusuchus
-
related
taxa
(
Baurusuchus
,
Stratiotosuchus
,
Penhuechesuchus
,
Pabweshi
and
Wargosuchus
)
,
Sphagesaurus
-
related
taxa
(
Sphagesaurus
,
Adamantinasuchus
and
Armadillosuchus
)
,
Araripesuchus
,
and
other
more
basal
taxa
with
a
controversial
systematic
position
,
such
as
Notosuchus
,
Uruguaysuchus
,
Malawisuchus
,
Comahuesuchus
,
Mariliasuchus
,
Simosuchus
,
Anatosuchus
,
Yacarerani
and
Morrinhosuchus
,
Peirosaurus
,
Lomasuchus
,
Uberabasuchus
,
Montealtosuchus
and
Hamadasuchus
are
defined
by
the
same
authors
as
part
of
a
larger
clade
named
Sebecia
and
closely
related
to
the
Paleogene
Sebecus
and
the
aquatic
Stolokrosuchus
,
all
of
them
nested
within
the
most
primitive
Neosuchia
.
A
peculiar
aspect
of
these
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
is
that
some
of
them
are
cosmopolitan
,
whether
others
seem
to
be
endemic
.
Basal
Notosuchia
are
found
in
Brazil
(
Uiraúna
,
Parnaíba
,
Parecis
and
Bauru
basins
)
,
Uruguay
(
Litoral
Basin
,
Guichón
Formation
)
,
Bolívia
(
Cajones
Formation
)
,
Argentina
(
Neuquén
Basin
)
,
Africa
(
Malawi
Dinosaur
Beds
,
Koum
,
Tegama
basins
)
and
Madagascar
(
Mahajanga
Basin
)
.
Araripesuchus
are
found
in
Brazil
(
Araripe
Basin
)
,
Argentina
(
Neuquén
Basin
)
,
Africa
(
Kem
Kem
Beds
,
Koum
and
Tegama
basins
)
and
Madagascar
(
Mahajanga
basin
)
.
The
Sebecian
peirosaurids
are
found
in
Brazil
(
Bauru
Basin
)
,
Argentina
(
Neuquén
Basin
)
and
Morocco
(
Kem
Kem
Beds
)
.
The
Notosuchian
baurusuchids
are
found
in
Brazil
(
Bauru
Basin
)
,
Argentina
(
Neuquén
Basin
)
and
Pakistan
(
Pab
Formation
,
Balochistan
Province
)
.
The
Notosuchian
sphagesaurids
are
the
only
group
still
restricted
to
South
America
(
Bauru
Basin
,
Brazil
)
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
.
According
to
Markwick
(
1998
)
the
distribution
of
living
crocodylians
is
climatically
controlled
by
a
mean
annual
temperature
equal
to
or
more
than
14.2
°
C
,
although
local
hydrological
conditions
play
an
important
role
,
providing
a
buffer
effect
against
temperature
extremes
and
a
fully
adequate
environment
for
the
amphibious
niche
of
the
extant
Eusuchia
.
Thus
,
the
extant
crocodylians
are
limited
to
tropical
and
subtropical
environments
.
The
analysis
of
the
distribution
of
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
carried
out
on
the
Early
and
Late
Cretaceous
palaeogeographic
and
palaeoclimatic
maps
(
Scotese
,
2005
)
shows
a
spatial
distribution
of
the
same
pattern
as
that
of
modern
crocodylians
.
It
indicates
that
temperature
was
the
principal
influence
on
their
global
distribution
.
It
is
possible
that
these
crocodyliforms
developed
ecological
strategies
that
allowed
them
to
live
in
a
hot
and
arid
climate
.
Therefore
the
rare
Cretaceous
Eusuchian
crocodylians
are
excluded
from
this
analysis
,
because
they
are
semi-aquatic
to
aquatic
,
so
they
are
not
influenced
by
the
terrestrial
environment
.
Extant
species
are
known
to
endure
severe
low
humidity
in
the
Sahara
desert
region
,
but
even
then
are
closely
linked
to
the
small
aquatic
habitats
within
the
arid
environment
(
Richardson
et
al.
,
2002
)
.
Available
data
from
the
studied
dinosaurs
from
Brazil
,
Argentina
,
Africa
and
Madagascar
do
not
support
any
specific
adaptation
to
different
terrains
or
climates
in
Gondwana
.
In
Brazil
,
fossils
of
terrestrial
crocodyliforms
outnumber
those
of
dinosaurs
.
More
specifically
,
the
preservation
of
crocodyliform
fossils
,
even
from
outcrops
yielding
dinosaurs
,
is
outstanding
.
The
same
outcrops
yield
fully
preserved
crocodyliforms
and
scarce
and
fragmentary
dinosaur
fossils
.
These
observations
are
relevant
to
the
analyses
undertaken
here
.
There
are
no
macro-fossil
plants
or
palynomorphs
associated
with
these
crocodyliforms
.

The
paleobiogeographic
context
of
the
Cretaceous
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
of
Gondwana
The
paleobiogeographic
synthesis
of
Bonaparte
(
1986
)
allowed
an
insight
into
the
faunal
distribution
and
vicariant
events
in
Gondwana
throughout
the
Mesozoic
.
However
,
paleobiogeographic
studies
concerning
the
distribution
of
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
have
shown
conflicting
results
.
Due
the
high
diversity
,
widespread
distribution
and
a
largely
terrestrial
habit
,
the
crocodyliform
phylogeny
is
considered
adequate
to
explore
paleobiogeographical
events
.
Turner
(
2004
)
,
through
a
cladistic
paleobiogeographical
method
,
suggested
that
the
vicariant
biogeographical
pattern
played
a
major
role
in
determining
the
paleogeographical
distribution
of
the
Crocodyliformes
,
in
spite
of
dispersal
and
regional
extinction
(
Fig.
3
and
Fig.
4
)
.
The
similarities
of
the
vertebrate
faunas
across
Gondwana
led
to
the
assumption
of
a
South
American
–
African
–
Madagascar
–
Antarctica
–
India
–
Australia
(
Chatterjee
and
Scotese
,
1999
)
connection
until
the
Aptian
(
Buffetaut
and
Taquet
,
1979
,
Buffetaut
,
1980
,
Buffetaut
,
1981
and
Buffetaut
,
1982
)
.
A
land
bridge
may
have
existed
at
least
up
to
the
Albian
–
Cenomanian
(
Calvo
and
Salgado
,
1996
)
.
Notwithstanding
the
opening
of
the
South
Atlantic
,
Buffetaut
,
1980
and
Buffetaut
,
1982
also
considered
the
possibility
of
intermittent
faunal
interchange
after
the
Albian
,
through
a
chain
of
islands
between
Africa
and
South
America
or
even
a
connection
through
Antarctica
and
Australia
.
Ortega
et
al.
(
2000
)
,
through
the
analysis
of
Araripesuchus
,
considered
that
phylogenetically
related
taxa
do
not
necessarily
presuppose
the
existence
of
a
continental
nexus
during
the
Aptian
,
and
the
archosaurian
fauna
could
have
been
previously
isolated
in
each
continent
.
These
authors
postulated
that
the
distribution
of
the
basal
Notosuchia
and
Araripesuchus
does
not
support
the
hypothesis
of
terrestrial
connections
between
South
America
and
Africa
after
the
Albian
.
Therefore
,
the
Cretaceous
paleobiogeography
of
Gondwana
presents
problems
concerning
the
distribution
of
some
taxa
,
like
the
Notosuchia
,
previously
considered
to
have
an
exclusively
Gondwanan
record
(
Gasparini
,
1971
,
Gasparini
,
1996
,
Bonaparte
,
1986
and
Gomani
,
1997
)
.
The
idea
of
a
non-endemic
tetrapod
fauna
during
the
Cretaceous
in
Gondwana
is
reinforced
by
the
studies
of
Hallam
,
1967
,
Hallam
,
1972
,
Colbert
,
1975
,
Buffetaut
,
1987
and
Molnar
,
1989
that
noted
a
conflict
between
the
idea
of
island
continents
and
the
distribution
of
vertebrate
fossils
.
As
argued
by
Chatterjee
and
Hotton
,
1986
and
Chatterjee
and
Scotese
,
1999
,
India
could
not
have
been
an
isolated
island
during
the
Cretaceous
and
early
Cenozoic
,
because
there
was
no
development
of
endemic
faunas
and
floras
.
The
lack
of
endemism
among
Indian
Cretaceous
terrestrial
vertebrates
is
inconsistent
with
the
island
continent
hypothesis
.
Based
on
the
vertebrate
terrestrial
data
,
geological
and
geophysical
evidence
,
Chatterjee
and
Scotese
,
1999
and
Chatterjee
and
Scotese
,
2007
,
presented
new
paleogeographical
maps
to
the
Early
and
Late
Cretaceous
with
several
possible
biogeographic
corridors
between
eastern
and
western
Gondwana
.
Then
,
the
main
concern
is
to
explain
the
paleogeographic
models
where
continental
connections
throughout
the
Cretaceous
did
not
exist
.
The
plate
tectonic
and
paleogeographic
reconstructions
of
Barron
,
1987
,
Barron
et
al.
,
1981
,
Hay
et
al.
,
1990
,
Scotese
,
1991
and
Scotese
et
al.
,
1988
assumed
that
Eurasia
,
Greenland
,
North
America
,
South
America
,
Africa
,
Madagascar
,
India
,
Australia
,
and
Antarctica
were
separated
by
the
end
of
the
Early
Cretaceous
,
without
any
later
connections
,
by
deep
ocean
passages
between
these
major
continental
blocks
.
An
alternative
global
Cretaceous
paleogeography
,
to
these
traditional
models
,
was
proposed
by
Hay
et
al.
(
1999
)
and
in
a
paleobiogeographic
perspective
by
Sampson
et
al.
,
1998
,
Krause
et
al.
,
2006
and
Chatterjee
and
Scotese
,
2007
.
Their
global
plate
tectonic
reconstructions
present
three
continental
blocks
during
Early
Cretaceous
(
North
America
–
Eurasia
,
South
America
–
Antarctica
–
India
–
Madagascar
–
Australia
,
and
Africa
)
,
a
large
open
Pacific
Basin
,
a
wide
eastern
Tethys
and
a
circum-African
seaway
extending
from
the
western
Tethys
region
through
the
North
and
South
Atlantic
into
the
juvenile
Indian
Ocean
between
Madagascar-India
and
Africa
.
There
were
no
deep-water
passages
to
the
Arctic
.
The
proposal
of
Hay
et
al.
(
1999
)
,
of
an
Early
Cretaceous
Earth
with
a
long
,
narrow
,
sinuous
ocean
basin
extending
off
the
Tethys
,
contrasts
strongly
with
the
traditional
view
of
separated
island
continents
.

The
climatic
control
of
the
distribution
of
modern
crocodiles
Climatic
interpretations
using
fossil
crocodiles
are
based
on
the
climate
and
temperature
tolerances
of
their
extant
relatives
.
All
living
species
are
ectothermic
,
and
as
such
their
body
temperatures
correspond
closely
to
environmental
temperatures
,
that
in
turn
correspond
to
the
temperature
of
the
immediately
adjacent
environment
,
which
may
be
water
or
mud
,
rather
than
air
(
Markwick
,
1998
)
.
Biological
observations
of
living
species
allowed
Markwick
(
1998
)
to
consider
that
temperature
is
the
limiting
factor
to
the
distribution
of
crocodylians
and
that
climate
can
be
inferred
through
the
paleobiogeography
of
this
group
.
Basal
Notosuchia
,
sphagesaurids
,
baurusuchids
,
Araripesuchus
,
and
the
Sebecian
peirosaurids
were
clearly
terrestrial
animals
,
living
in
an
environment
marked
by
rainy
and
dry
seasons
in
an
arid
climate
.
Therefore
,
this
uniformitarian
approach
may
be
not
adequate
in
the
case
of
the
fossil
groups
of
Gondwana
.
The
observations
on
the
distribution
of
modern
crocodiles
by
Markwick
(
1998
)
indicate
that
temperature
is
the
principal
influence
on
their
global
distribution
,
with
the
coldest
monthly
mean
temperature
of
5.5
°
C
marking
the
minimum
thermal
limit
for
the
group
,
corresponding
today
to
a
minimum
mean
annual
temperature
of
14.2
°
C.
For
the
living
species
Alligator
mississippiensis
the
optimal
temperature
is
taken
as
being
32
–
35
°
C
.
The
duration
of
warmth
during
the
year
is
also
important
,
as
this
affects
sex
determination
,
early
juvenile
development
and
survival
.
The
presence
of
standing
water
or
burrows
provides
an
essential
thermal
buffer
against
temperature
extremes
(
Campbell
and
Mazzotti
,
2004
)
.
Coulson
et
al.
,
1989
and
Markwick
,
1998
found
that
the
metabolic
rate
is
a
function
of
size
and
temperature
,
with
the
lower
metabolic
rates
corresponding
to
larger
animals
and
colder
temperatures
.
This
size-based
differential
response
to
thermal
changes
is
a
direct
consequence
of
ectothermy
and
the
lack
of
an
internal
source
of
energy
.
Ectotherms
gain
and
lose
heat
as
a
function
of
their
heat
capacity
and
the
surface
area
across
which
heat
is
gained
or
lost
to
the
environment
(
Markwick
,
1998
)
.
This
could
be
used
to
infer
physiological
aspects
of
the
large
Notosuchia
such
as
baurusuchids
and
sphagesaurids
,
and
Sebecia
such
as
the
peirosaurids
from
the
Late
Cretaceous
.
As
an
individual
grows
larger
,
the
greater
its
body
surface
area
becomes
,
hence
,
the
more
heat
or
energy
is
required
to
raise
its
body
temperature
,
and
the
longer
it
takes
to
lose
heat
.
This
inertial
homeothermy
has
been
used
to
suggest
that
very
large
ectotherms
would
have
been
able
to
maintain
sufficient
body
temperatures
during
cold
periods
by
virtue
of
thermal
inertia
.
Seymour
et
al.
(
2004
)
even
suggest
that
extant
and
fossil
crocodylians
could
be
homeothermic
animals
,
a
primitive
ancestral
trait
among
archosaurs
.
Then
,
baurusuchids
,
peirosaurids
and
sphagesaurids
would
have
been
able
to
wander
large
distances
,
withstanding
the
heat
and
low
humidity
,
as
active
predators
in
a
harsh
environment
(
Vasconcellos
,
2006
)
.
Other
characteristics
are
unique
to
these
taxa
.
The
morphofunctional
and
ecological
inferences
used
to
determine
their
terrestrial
habits
were
based
on
skull
characters
(
position
and
orientation
of
orbits
and
external
nares
and
rostral
shape
)
and
some
postcranial
features
(
appendicular
bone
shape
and
stoutness
,
osteoderms
,
pelvic
girdle
morphology
and
,
shape
of
manus
and
pes
)
discussed
by
Pol
,
2005
and
Marinho
et
al.
,
2006
and
Vasconcellos
(
2009
)
.
All
them
show
a
profound
adaptation
to
fully
terrestrial
niches
and
even
cursoriality
.

The
climatic
role
in
the
paleobiogeographic
distribution
of
Cretaceous
Crocodyliformes
The
Cretaceous
is
generally
considered
as
an
ice-free
period
,
although
there
are
several
reports
of
deposits
formed
by
ice
transport
at
high-latitude
sites
(
Gregory
et

.
During
this
period
,
what
is
possibly
one
of
the
warmest
intervals
in
Earth
history
,
the
climate
was
in
an
extreme
‘
greenhouse
’
mode
(
Barron
and
Peterson
,
1989
,
Spicer
and
Corfield
,
1992
,
Barron
et
al.
,
1993
and
Tajika
,
1999
)
.
From
the
marine
record
,
a
cool
interval
in
the
Early
Cretaceous
is
followed
by
warming
lasting
until
the
late
Albian
.
The
stable
isotope
evidence
and
paleobotanical
data
indicates
in
mid-Cretaceous
a
warm
,
equable
condition
of
the
ocean
waters
(
Crowley
and
North
,
1996
,
Herman
and
Spicer
,
1996
and
Fassell
and
Bralower
,
1999
)
.
Then
,
hurricane
formation
should
have
been
more
frequent
in
the
mid-Cretaceous
than
in
the
Early
Cretaceous
when
ocean
temperatures
were
likely
to
have
been
cooler
.
The
analysis
presented
by
Lloyd
(
1982
)
based
on
paleogeography
,
ocean
circulation
and
temperature
indicated
that
there
was
greater
seasonality
of
wind
patterns
during
the
mid-Cretaceous
,
leading
to
more
extreme
climates
over
the
continents
,
with
slightly
equator-ward
positions
of
the
subtropical
anticyclones
and
monsoonal
regimes
over
the
continental
margins
bordering
Tethys
and
the
central
Atlantic
.
The
latitudinal
distribution
of
relative
humidity
presented
by
Ufnar
et
al.
(
2002
)
for
the
mid-Cretaceous
,
indicates
dry
belts
in
the
paleolatitudes
of
20
–
40
°
and
60
–
80
°
.
These
can
also
be
observed
in
the
paleoclimatic
maps
of
Scotese
(
2005
)
.
Late
Cretaceous
orography
strongly
influenced
the
distribution
of
precipitation
and
the
paleogeographic
distribution
of
deserts
.
Large
intercontinental
deserts
dominated
the
low-lying
continental
interiors
of
South
America
,
Africa
,
and
southwest
Asia
(
De
Conto
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
Increased
greenhouse
gases
in
the
atmosphere
could
explain
the
generally
warm
state
of
Late
Cretaceous
climates
(
Frakes
,
1999
)
;
although
some
authors
(
Barrera
,
1994
and
D'Hondt
and
Arthur
,
1996
)
considered
the
temperature
of
the
Maastrichtian
sea
surface
waters
to
have
been
lower
than
those
of
today
.
The
Santonian
–
Campanian
was
generally
a
cool
time
,
except
for
a
strong
warming
in
the
marine
environment
in
the
late
Campanian
.
For
the
continental
landmasses
,
there
was
continuous
warming
from
the
Albian
to
a
peak
in
the
Turonian
,
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
reversal
to
cooling
in
the
Cenomanian
,
as
seen
in
the
marine
record
.
A
Coniacian
–
Santonian
warming
is
poorly
defined
,
being
seen
only
in
the
high-latitude
data
.
Comparisons
of
selected
Cretaceous
temperature
gradients
with
those
of
the
present
reveal
that
continental
gradients
may
have
been
warmer
than
at
present
.
During
latest
Cenomanian
–
earliest
Turonian
there
was
an
ultra-thermal
greenhouse
event
(
Frakes
,
1990
)
,
and
the
reptile
assemblage
of
Turonian
–
Coniacian
from
the
Artic
indicates
a
mean
annual
temperature
exceeding
14
°
C
.
These
high
polar
temperatures
implied
raised
equatorial
temperatures
(
Tarduno
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Parrish
and
Spicer
(
1988
)
,
based
on
terrestrial
vegetation
,
inferred
Artic
temperatures
no
higher
than
13
°
C
during
Albian
–
Coniacian
.
There
,
the
Campanian
and
Maastrichtian
mean
annual
Arctic
temperature
would
have
been
about
2
–
8
°
C
.
The
Amiot
et
al.
(
2004
)
analysis
reveals
a
similar
signature
from
the
point
of
view
of
continental
vertebrates
.
Therefore
the
Campanian
climate
in
lower
latitudes
was
warm
and
wet
,
with
a
global
mean
annual
temperature
of
24.1
°
C
(
about
10
°
C
higher
than
today
)
(
Barron
and
Peterson
,
1989
and
Barron
et
al.
,
1993
)
.
The
high-latitude
continental
landmasses
close
to
the
polar
oceans
,
were
not
cold
enough
to
induce
ice
sheet
formation
.
Model
simulations
of
Upchurch
et
al.
(
1999
)
demonstrated
an
important
climatic
linkage
between
the
oceans
and
the
land
surface
in
the
Maastrichtian
.
Sea
ice
development
is
inhibited
by
warmer
oceans
,
which
delay
the
formation
of
sea
ice
in
winter
and
reduce
both
its
thickness
and
fractional
cover
.
The
warm
high-latitude
temperatures
during
the
Late
Cretaceous
could
have
resulted
from
the
interaction
of
increased
pCO
2
,
paleogeography
,
and
a
reduced
surface
albedo
due
to
forest
vegetation
(
Donnadieu
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
The
climatic
fluctuations
inferred
for
the
Sergipe
Basin
during
Late
Cretaceous
by
Carmo
and
Pratt
(
1999
)
suggests
a
high
degree
of
biotic
sensitivity
to
continental
climatic
variability
at
low
latitudes
under
global
greenhouse
conditions
.
Then
,
the
equatorial
climatic
dynamics
probably
affected
large
portions
of
the
evolving
South
Atlantic
Ocean
due
to
the
narrow
,
elongate
shape
of
the
oceanic
passage
and
the
close
proximity
of
Africa
and
South
America
.
During
the
Cretaceous
,
tectonics
and
climate
were
both
directly
and
indirectly
related
,
through
uplift
,
atmospheric
circulation
,
the
hydrologic
cycle
,
and
volcanism
(
Hay
,
1996
and
Poulsen
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
The
Cretaceous
was
a
highly
active
period
tectonically
,
with
many
different
landmass
configurations
.
During
this
time
,
the
rifting
of
continental
blocks
involved
broad
upwarping
followed
by
subsidence
of
a
central
valley
and
uplift
of
marginal
shoulders
.
Hay
(
1996
)
demonstrated
that
in
this
context
the
result
is
an
evolving
regional
climate
consisting
first
of
a
vapor-trapping
arch
,
followed
by
a
rift
valley
with
freshwater
lakes
and
playa
lake
deposits
,
culminating
in
an
arid
rift
bordered
by
mountains
intercepting
incoming
precipitation
.
Gondwana
,
as
a
large
continent
,
caused
disruption
of
zonal
atmospheric
circulation
and
the
establishment
of
monsoonal
circulation
.
The
great
land
area
of
Gondwana
would
have
changed
the
paths
of
the
wind
systems
(
controlled
by
the
tropical
Hadley
cells
,
mid-latitude
Ferrel
cells
,
and
polar
cells
)
,
creating
an
oceanic
subtropical
high-pressure
and
high
mid-latitude
low
pressure
cells
and
increasing
poleward
heat
and
moisture
transport
in
the
Southern
Hemisphere
.
In
general
,
rainfall
was
controlled
by
the
zonal
pattern
and
was
heaviest
on
the
windward
sides
of
mountains
and
where
airflow
crossed
the
coastline
into
the
continent
.
Besides
this
,
there
was
the
strongly
seasonal
monsoon
.
The
seasonality
would
have
been
strong
because
of
the
isolation
of
the
continental
interior
from
the
ameliorating
influence
of
the
surrounding
ocean
.
Seasonality
would
have
been
particularly
strong
when
the
continent
was
centered
in
mid-latitudes
,
covering
regions
of
maximum
cooling
and
heating
.
Both
temperature
and
precipitation
would
have
fluctuated
strongly
with
the
seasons
(
Riccardi
,
1988
,
Parrish
,
1990
and
Scherer
and
Goldberg
,
in
press
)
.
Aridity
is
another
aspect
of
the
greenhouse
effect
in
the
landmasses
of
Gondwana
.
There
is
a
strong
dependence
of
water
vapor
content
on
temperature
at
the
surface
.
The
increase
in
the
evaporative
capacity
of
warmer
air
over
land
may
not
be
satisfied
by
the
moisture
available
,
and
as
a
result
,
global
warming
increases
the
aridity
of
land
areas
on
a
global
scale
(
Wolfe
and
Upchurch
,
1987
,
Hay
,
1996
and
Price
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Volcanic
activity
can
also
influence
the
climate
,
due
to
effects
on
sea
level
changes
,
paleobathymetry
,
oceanic
circulation
,
and
chemistry
of
the
atmosphere
and
hydrosphere
(
Budyko
and
Ronov
,
1979
and
Schlanger
and
Arthur
,
1990
)
.
Khadkikar
et
al.
(
1999
)
interpreted
the
Maastrichtian
semi-arid
climate
of
the
Indian
Peninsula
as
the
result
of
Deccan
volcanism
.
Basaltic
volcanism
was
a
significant
mechanism
of
introducing
aerosols
into
the
atmosphere
,
allowing
short-term
global
surface
cooling
.
On
the
local
scale
,
this
volcanism
may
lead
to
aridity
,
as
it
produced
fresh
barren
xeric
landscapes
.
Between
65.5
and
65.3
Ma
high
climatic
and
oceanic
variability
occurred
,
that
warmed
globally
by
3
–
4
°
C.
Barrera
and
Savin
(
1999
)
interpreted
this
global
warming
as
related
to
the
Deccan
Trap
volcanism
at
the
end
of
the
Cretaceous
.
The
global
Cretaceous
paleogeography
of
Hay
et
al.
(
1999
)
,
showing
an
Early
Cretaceous
Earth
with
a
long
,
narrow
,
sinuous
ocean
basin
extending
off
the
Tethys
,
provides
a
markedly
different
set
of
boundary
conditions
for
a
climate
model
and
also
to
the
possibilities
of
dispersal
of
the
terrestrial
crocodyliforms
.
During
the
first
stages
of
the
South
Atlantic
opening
,
the
Falkland
Plateau
carried
Madagascar
–
India
–
Antarctica
–
Australia
with
it
in
an
arc
.
Subsequently
,
South
America
and
Africa
separated
along
a
transform
fault
between
the
northeastern
margin
of
Brazil
and
Guinea
coast
of
Africa
.
Although
Antarctica
moved
south
,
the
Antarctic
Peninsula
remained
in
contact
with
the
southern
Andes
,
forming
a
continuous
mountain
chain
that
was
not
interrupted
until
the
Oligocene
.
In
the
Indian
Ocean
,
India
first
moved
south
with
Antarctica
and
Madagascar
.
In
the
Early
Cretaceous
,
India
began
to
rotate
away
from
Antarctica
,
moving
along
a
transform
fault
and
sliding
past
Madagascar
.
However
,
it
remained
connected
to
Antarctica
by
a
land
bridge
until
final
separation
in
the
Late
Cretaceous
,
when
it
also
separated
from
Madagascar
(

.
Chatterjee
and
Scotese
(
1999
)
pointed
out
that
the
evolution
of
the
Indian
plate
is
the
most
complex
and
least
understood
of
all
Gondwanan
landmasses
.
As
India
did
not
rift
apart
from
Pangea
in
one
simple
motion
,
but
during
several
distinct
episodes
,
even
during
the
Cretaceous
there
was
contact
of
India
with
adjacent
landmasses
that
allowed
transcontinental
migration
routes
.
Deep-water
passages
between
the
Tethys
,
the
Atlantic
,
the
Pacific
,
and
the
developing
Indian
Ocean
formed
during
the
Late
Cretaceous
.
There
were
many
isolated
land
areas
in
the
Late
Cretaceous
,
but
mostly
they
were
separated
by
epicontinental
seas
(
Hay
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
As
Mayhew
et
al.
(
2008
)
demonstred
,
global
climate
explains
substantial
variation
in
the
fossil
record
due
to
accelerated
rates
of
extinction
and
origin
of
species
,
genera
and
even
families
.
The
stratigraphic
context
of
the
Cretaceous
terrestrial
Crocodyliformes
also
reinforces
this
idea
of
a
climate-controlled
distribution
of
faunas
.
In
the
Early
Cretaceous
north
and
northeastern
Brazilian
basins
of
Parnaíba
and
Araripe
,
Candidodon
itapecuruense
(
Aptian
)
is
found
in
fluvial-lacustrine
sediments
and
Araripesuchus
gomesii
occurs
in
carbonate
nodules
of
the
Santana
Formation
(
Aptian-Albian
)
,
both
in
a
context
of
an
arid
climate
.
The
palaeoenvironmental
setting
of
the
fine
sandstones
where
the
Late
Cretaceous
species
of
the
Bauru
Basin

The
occurrence
of
almost
complete
articulated
skeletons
,
as
for
Mariliasuchus
amarali
,
Baurusuchus
salgadoensis
,
Uberabasuchus
terrificus
,
Adamantinasuchus
navae
and
Montealtosuchus
arrudacamposi
,
suggests
these
crocodyliforms
could
dig
large
,
deep
excavations
in
the
soft
substrates
that
,
like
the
“
alligator
holes
”
of
extant
alligators
assisted
thermoregulation
(
Cott
,
1961
,
Richardson
et
al.
,
2002
,
Campbell
and
Mazzotti
,
2004
,
Palmer
and
Mazzotti
,
2004
and
Vasconcellos
and
Carvalho
,
2006
)
.
These
excavations
also
retain
water
during
dry
periods
.
This
ethological
aspect
probably
allowed
them
to
live
in
more
terrestrial
and
arid
environments
(
Campos
et
al.
,
2005
and
Vasconcellos
and
Carvalho
,
2006
)
than
other
crocodyliforms
.
Alternativally
,
these
animals
could
have
used
the
burrows
only
during
hot
days
,
being
active
at
dawn
and
dusk
.
It
seems
also
plausible
to
imagine
use
of
a
shelter
in
the
shade
during
the
hottest
periods
,
and
nocturnal
activity
(
Stéphane
Jouve
,
2010
,
pers
.
comm
.
)
.
Freshwater
ponds
and
rivers
were
scarce
,
generally
drying
out
during
long
droughts
.
This
was
a
very
restrictive
factor
and
the
fauna
and
flora
of
this
region
should
be
well
adapted
to
endure
these
severe
environmental
conditions
.
Flash
floods
during
rainy
seasons
represented
catastrophic
events
that
allowed
the
fossilization
of
articulated
skeletons
.
Goldberg
and
Garcia
(
2000
)
have
interpreted
an
increase
in
aridity
through
time
,
from
the
Early
to
the
Late
Cretaceous
.
In
the
northern
region
of
the
Bauru
Basin
(
Uberaba
County
)
,
Garcia
et
al.
(
1999
)
argued
that
the
paleoclimatic
conditions
changed
to
become
more
arid
during
the
Maastrichtian
.
This
aridity
was
considered
by
Goldberg
and
Garcia
(
2000
)
to
reflect
the
global
climatic
conditions
and
the
existence
of
topographic
heights
that
allowed
the
development
of
a
dry
microclimate
in
the
region
.
The
more
humid
climate
was
restricted
to
the
surrounding
mountains
that
acted
as
geographic
barriers
to
the
entry
of
humid
winds
.
The
climatic
seasonality
was
marked
by
longer
dry
intervals
interrupted
by
periods
of
heavy
rains
,
when
small
lakes
and
temporary
ponds
,
which
were
relatively
deep
during
the
flood
periods
(
Senra
and
Silva
e
Silva
,
1999
)
,
supported
an
abundant
and
diversified
flora
and
fauna
.

are

(

The
Argentinean
specimens
occur
in
successions
of
massive
coarse
and
medium-grained
sandstones
and
conglomerates
,
fine
sandstones
,
siltstones
and
mudstones
deposited
in
fluvial
environments
under
braided
and
meandering
regimes
(
Leanza
et
al.
,
2004
and
Pol
and
Gasparini
,

)
.
Araripesuchus
patagonicus
from
the
Candeleros
Formation
occur
in
medium
-
to
fine-grained
sandstones
with
pelitic
intraclasts
in
tabular
bodies
.
Rapid
sedimentation
was
interpreted
from
the
presence
of
articulated
specimens
.
The
depositional
environment
was
fluvial
,
subjected
to
a
regime
of
sporadic
seasonal
flooding
,
in
a
climate
with
alternate
rainy
and
dry
periods
(
Ortega
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
In
Uruguay
(
Litoral
Basin
,
Guichón
Formation
)
,
Uruguaysuchus
aznarezi
and
Uruguaysuchus
terrai
are
found
in
a
succession
of
argillaceous
fine
sandstones
,
reddish
,
with
climbing
ripples
,
laminar
and
cross
stratification
,
pedogenetic
structures
(
root
bioturbation
)
and
carbonate
nodules
.
There
are
also
reddish
and
brown
mudstones
where
Uruguaysuchus
occur
.
Aguilar
and
Perea
(
2003
)
interpreted
these
deposits
as
fluvial
bars
and
abandoned
channels
,
in
environmental
conditions
of
low
humidity
.
The
distribution
of
these
faunas
in
South
America
,
besides
being
controlled
by
the
well-marked
seasons
,
was
also
controlled
by
the
regional
tectonics
.
The
drainage
history
of
South
America
,
as
shown
by
Potter
(
1997
)
,
was
subject
to
tectonic
control
first
by
regional
uplifts
and
associated
aulacogens
and
later
(
100
Ma
)
by
colliding
plates
,
which
reversed
paleoslopes
on
much
of
the
South
American
platform
.
During
the
Early
Cretaceous
,
the
drainage
in
Patagonia
(
including
Magallanes
and
Neuquén
basins
)
was
towards
the
paleo-Pacific
and
sediment
source
areas
were
to
the
East
and
North
.
A
compressional
tectonic
event
,
related
to
the
South
America-Africa
rifting
,
reversed
the
slope
to
the
southeast
,
allowing
a
distinct
connection
of
the
fluvial
network
.
Musacchio
(
2000
)
,
based
on
charophyte
distribution
,
proposed
that
there
was
a
break-down
of
the
biogeographic
isolation
between
the
southern
and
northern
regions
of
South
America
during
the
Aptian
.
The
connections
of
the
drainage
system
of
southern
Argentina
and
central
South
America
(
e.g.
Bauru
Basin
)
from
the
Aptian
to
the
Late
Cretaceous
probably
allowed
the
interchange
of
the
crocodyliforms
and
the
occurrence
of
common
taxa
of
Peirosauridae
(
Peirosaurus
torminni
)
and
Baurusuchidae
(
Cynodontosuchus
rothi
)
both
in
Argentina
and
Brazil
(
Gasparini
et
al.
,
1991
and
Gasparini
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
Also
concerning
the
terrestrial
groups
,
Comahuesuchus
brachybuccalis
(
Argentina
)
,
according
to
Martinelli
(
2003
)
is
closely
related
to
Malawisuchus
mwakasyungutiensis
(
Malawi
)
and
to
Sphagesaurus
huenei
(
Brazil
)
.
Other
terrestrial
crocodyliforms
such
as
the
baurusuchids
also
indicate
these
relationships
.
Wilson
et
al.
(
2001
)
considered
an
Early
Cretaceous
,
or
even
a
Late
Cretaceous
Gondwanic
‘
terrestrial
route
’
between
South
America
and
Indo-Pakistan
via
Antarctica
,
to
explain
the
presence
of
this
group
in
the
Indian
subcontinent
(
today
,
Asia
)
.
Later
,
during
the
Paleogene
,
their
dispersal
through
Eurasia
allowed
them
to
reach
North
Africa
and
Iberia
,
an
alternative
and
plausible
‘
land
corridor
’
to
the
classic
South
America-Madagascar-Africa
connection
.
Araripesuchus
sp
.
also
exhibit
a
broad
distribution
,
as
they
occur
in
Brazil
,
Argentina
(
South
America
)
,
Cameroon
,
Morocco
,
Republic
of
Niger
(
Africa
)
and
Madagascar
.
In
the
Mahajanga
Basin
(
Madagascar
)
,
the
Maastrichtian
strata
(
Maevarano
Formation
,
Anembalemba
Member
)
that
yield
Araripesuchus
tsangatsangana
,
Simosuchus
clarki
and
Mahajangasuchus
insignis
,
consist
of
complexly
interbedded
sandstones
facies
,
that
accumulated
in
a
broad
channel-belt
system
characterized
by
shallow
flow
and
an
ephemeral
discharge
regime
prone
to
floods
(
Buckley
et
al.
,
2000
,
Turner
,
2006
and
Turner
and
Buckley
,

)
.
The
sandstone
facies
(
massive
sandstones
poorly
sorted
)
,
in
which
numerous
bonebeds
are
generally
found
,
is
interpreted
by
Rogers
et
al.
(
2000
)
to
represent
events
of
rapid
sediment
dumping
presumably
during
floods
in
aggrading
channel
belts
.
This
signal
of
discharge
variability
,
presumably
reflects
seasonality
in
the
Late
Cretaceous
of
northwestern
Madagascar
,
in
a
climate
marked
by
distinct
rainy
and
dry
seasons
.
The
Malawi
crocodyliform
Malawisuchus
mwakasyungutiensis
comes
from
Aptian
red
beds
of
the
Mwakasyunguti
area
,
Karonga
District
(
Gomani

.
In

isolated
teeth

by
Jacobs

(

to
pertain
to
aff
.
Araripesuchus

are
found
in

sediments
.
All
these
fossils
occurred
in
fluvial
deposits
,
in
an
arid
climatic
belt
during
Lower
Cretaceous
as
presented
by
Scotese
(

)
(

Pabwehshi
pakistanensis
from
Pab
Formation
(
Pakistan
,
Maastrichtian
)
is
known
from
deposits
of
upwardly-fining
sandstones
,
with
poor
sorting
,
where
there
is
an
upwardly-decreasing
bed
thickness
,
with
trough
cross-bedding
.
There
are
silty
to
muddy
matrices
in
the
upper
part
of
the
sandstones
.
This
succession
was
interpreted
by
Wilson
et
al.
(
2001
)
as
fluvial
(
overbank
)
deposits
.
The
wide
extent
of
the
Gondwanan
landmass
,
even
when
it
began
to
break
up
,
implies
that
the
interior
of
the
continent
was
arid
.
Even
in
the
absence
of
mountains
,
warm
winds
flowing
landward
lose
their
moisture
over
land
because
heating
drives
the
air
masses
upward
.
Thus
,
in
low
latitudes
,
rainfall
not
only
would
have
been
seasonal
,
but
also
confined
to
coastal
regions
.
Although
the
interior
of
a
large
continent
would
receive
little
precipitation
at
any
latitude
,
climate
would
not
be
uniformly
arid
over
the
entire
continent
.
At
high
latitudes
,
where
temperatures
are
cooler
and
evaporation
rates
correspondingly
lower
,
the
climate
may
appear
to
have
been
humid
,
even
though
precipitation
was
relatively
low
.
Conversely
,
at
low
latitudes
,
aridity
will
be
more
severe
with
low
rainfall
due
to
temperature
and
lower
evaporation
rates
(
Parrish
,
1990
)
.
Wherever
the
pattern
of
vicariance
,
dispersal
and
distribution
of
these
terrestrial
crocodyliforms
,
the
paleoenvironmental
conditions
were
similar
.
The
main
environmental
control
was
certainly
the
arid
climate
.
This
could
be
reflected
in
the
morphology
and
paleoecololgy
of
these
crocodyliforms
,
which
have
lateral
orbits
,
external
nares
placed
anteriorly
,
differentiated
teeth
along
the
tooth
row
and
erect
limb
posture
.
This
anatomical
pattern
implies
ambulatory
,
or
even
cursorial
habits
,
in
continental
terrestrial
environments
(
Vasconcellos
et
al.
,
2005
and
Vasconcellos
and
Carvalho
,
2007

Conclusions
Climate
's
role
in
the
control
of
the
fossil
crocodyliform
distribution
has
been
generally
neglected
.
The
clues
to
understand
the
high
diversification
of
the
terrestrial
crocodyliforms
,
with
some
‘
bizarre
’
morphotypes
,
are
related
to
the
climatic
pattern
and
to
the
paleogeographic
models
of
Gondwanan
evolution
throughout
the
Cretaceous
.
The
marked
seasonality
,
with
distinct
rainy
and
dry
seasons
,
as
interpreted
for
the
deposits
of
distinct
ages
where
the
terrestrial
Cretaceous
crocodyliforms
have
been
found
,
are
indicative
of
stressed
and
fragile
ecosystems
.
Climatic
interpretations
using
fossil
crocodylians
are
based
on
the
climatic
tolerance
of
their
extant
relatives
.
Therefore
,
this
uniformitarian
approach
may
not
be
appropriate
in
the
case
of
the
fossil
groups
of
Gondwana
.
Basal
Notosuchia
,
Araripesuchus
and
some
Sebecia
were
clearly
terrestrial
animals
,
living
in
semi-arid
environments
markedly
distinct
from
the
swampy
areas
that
are
the
preferred
habitats
of
the
amphibious
extant
crocodiles
,
gharials
and
alligators
.
There
is
a
distinct
distribution
pattern
of
the
terrestrial
crocodyliform
faunas
throughout
Cretaceous
.
The
oldest
ones
are
the
small
and
omnivorous
Notosuchia
and
Araripesuchus
,
found
preferentially
in
Early
Cretaceous
deposits
.
They
are
followed
by
larger
Notosuchia
(
baurusuchids
,
sphagesaurids
)
and
Araripesuchus
,
and
Sebecian
peirosaurids
,
with
specializations
indicating
active
terrestrial
predatory
habits
.
Probably
,
they
temporally
succeed
the
Basal
Notosuchia
and
Araripesuchus
faunas
.
Those
larger
Crocodyliformes
were
in
some
way
,
a
response
to
a
significant
environmental
change
,
probably
a
hotter
and
drier
climate
in
the
Late
Cretaceous
Gondwanan
landmasses
.
The
aridity
,
or
maybe
a
seasonal
warm
and
dry
climate
,
that
alternated
with
wetter
periods
,
played
a
role
,
that
has
not
yet
been
analyzed
,
that
may
explain
the
domain
of
these
bizarre
crocodylians
in
Gondwana
during
the
Cretaceous
.
