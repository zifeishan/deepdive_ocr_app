Plant mega- and microfossil assemblages from the Brunssumian of `Hambach' near Düren, B.R.D. Abstract A series of 19 carpological samples, 9 of them from a 50 cm thick section, were collected from Late Brunssumian deposits in the browncoal open-cast mine `Hambach'. They were analyzed together with two leaf assemblages collected from the same horizon. They reveal a change from wetland forest to reed vegetation together with an increasing influence of allochthonous elements. Some plant species new to the region were found: Carex appropinquata , Euphorbia palustris , Salix sp. (seeds), Urtica dubia . The difference between the composition of leaf and carpological assemblage from the same deposits is elucidated. The incorporation of palynological data helps to clarify the nature of the vegetation.

Introduction In the opencast mine `Hambach' ( Fig. 1 ) a thick series of deposits, younger than the Miocene browncoal, is exposed. One of them consists of a double layer of clay, separated by a thin bed of sand. In the local stratigraphy these are designated as layer nos. 9 A, B, and C, from base to top. The sequence is also known as the Rotton Formation and is dated as Brunssumian, i.e. early, middle and late Brunssumian. In several places, the upper clay bed contains allochthonous leaf-compressions, which have been described by Van Lidth de Jeude and Van der Burgh (1989) and Belz (1992) . The base of the upper clay bed (9 C) is locally a very coaly, black humic clay, with a maximum thickness of ca. 50 cm. A number of leaf-compressions were collected from this layer during the late summer of 1982. In addition some samples for fruit/seed analysis were taken from the base as well as the top of this clay bed. Moreover, a sample was collected from a banded clay in a riverchannel at the top of the sand bed (9 B). During the summer of 1983 a section of the 9 C clay beds was sampled from top to bottom, and in 1995 a number of leaf-compressions were collected from a comparable position in a silt, which graded at the top into a silty reddish clay with the well known allochthonous leaf-compressions. As far as can be inferred from the situation in the field this deposit represents a lateral equivalent of that of 1982/1983. The leaf and fruit/seed assemblages from both collections have been studied and the results are reproduced here. The leaves were identified with the help of cuticle analysis as well as gross morphology. However, the material of 1995 did not yield very good cuticle preparations. Ca. 2 kg of dried clay or silt were taken from the leaf containing specimens of both collections, disaggregated with H 2 O 2 10% and sieved. The same method has also been employed for processing the other fruit/seed samples. After drying, the material was sorted and the disseminules counted. The ecological analysis is made according to the method described by Van der Burgh, 1983 and Van der Burgh, 1987 ; Appendix A , ecological Tables A1–A21) and the results are graphically presented as histograms ( Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4 ). The sediments, which were employed for the palynological investigation, came from the leaf horizon (9 C) sampled in 1982. The clastic sediments were treated by the standard extraction techniques involving HCL and HF, and using CHBr 3 as heavy liquid ( Klaus, 1972 ). After acetolysis and examination of the pollen grains and the LM, these were transferred to a stub, where ethanol was used to remove the glycerine. The grains were then sputter-coated and examined under the SEM. 2. The leaf and carpological assemblages Annotated list of species; only those species, not mentioned in earlier papers of the author ( Van der Burgh, 1978 , Van der Burgh, 1983 , Van der Burgh, 1987 , Van der Burgh, 1988 , Van der Burgh, 1993 and Van der Burgh, 1995 ; Van Lidth de Jeude and Van der Burgh, 1989 ) are briefly characterized. A review of the ecology is based on the study of more extensive literature ( Weeda et al., 1985–1994 ) and a sequence of local floras, described in this paper. In comparison with previous papers, some changes in the assignment to the vegetational units are made. Acer campestre L. fruits Material studied : coll. no. 14380, 17648. Ecology : This is a tree of forest borders and dry forest on lime-rich soil; units 4, 5. Acer sp. fruits Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 17646. Remark : These seeds could not be identified to a specific level. Acer tricuspidatum Bronn ssp. lusaticum Walther leaves (Plate III, 9, 10; Plate IV, 1) Material studied : coll. no. 12642, 12644, 12657, peel no. 165. Remarks : Actinomorphous leaves with actinodromous venation; three primary veins diverging from the base of the leaf; margin coarsely dentate. Length/breadth 6–12 cm. Cuticle: epidermal cells isodiametric, pentagonal, walls straight; diameter 15–20 μm. Stomata anomocytic, variously orientated, length of stomatal cells 20–32 μm, width ca. 12 μm; with thickened inner stomatal walls. Stomatal slit ca. 20 μm long. Numerous unicellular trichomes, 60–120 μm long present, especially over the veins. This material can be compared with that described by Mai and Walther (1988) and Belz (1992) , although no striation of the epidermal cells could be observed. Ecology : The distantly related species, A. rubrum , is common in swampy areas and along sluggish streams; based on numerous finds of the leaves of A. tricuspidatum in local clays dating from the Late Miocene, the species is considered to have shown the same ecology; unit 3. Actinidia faveolata Reid et Reid seeds Material studied : coll. no. 14149, 14375, 14378, 14382, 14383, 14384, 14385, 14386, 17646. Ecology : Actinidia is a genus of lianas, which occur in forests but are normally fruiting only in a sunny position and therefore considered to be plants of the forest border; their regular presence in the samples of pure alder wetland forest, however, points to an occurrence in this type of forest; unit 3. Aesculus hippocastanum L. leaves (Plate IV, 2) Material studied : coll. no. 12640, 12647, 12649, 12656, 12658, 12664, 2669, 17967, 17973, peel no 150, 151, 152, 159. Remarks : The leaf material consists of laminae with a cuneate base and obovate shape. The margin is serrate, a stalk is normally absent. The length varies from 3.5 to 12 cm; the width from 2 to 5 cm. Venation: craspedodromous; angle of the straight secondaries to the primary all alike, veins of higher order not observed. The material matches the descriptions by Mai and Walther (1988) and Belz (1992) of Aesculus hippocastanum . Ecology : Aesculus is a tree of nutrient-rich, river bottom forests, which are inundated during the winter ( Fowells, 1965 ); unit 5.

Ecology : A. glutinosa , with which this species can be compared, is a plant of alder wetland forest, on nutrient-rich, permanently humid soil. It is easily damaged by flowing water during the growing season; unit 3. Alnus incana (L.) Moench leaves (Plate IV, 3–5; Plate VI, 4) Material studied : coll. no. 12672, 12673, 12674, 12676, 12677, 12679, 12680, 12682, 12683, 12684, 12686, 12687, 12688, 12689, 12690, 12691, 12692, 12693, 12694, 12695, 12696, 12697, 12698, 12699, 12700, 17946, 17947, 17948, 17949, 17950, 17951, 17952, 17953, 17954, 17955, 17956, 17957, 17958, 17960, 17961, peel no. 162. Remarks : This material consists of mesophyllous leaves; length: 4.5–9 cm, width 3–7 cm. The shape is ovate, the base rotundate-cordate. The margin is biserrate. The venation is craspedodromous, the secondaries vary in angle to the primary, the angle decreasing from base to apex. The secondaries are straight or slightly bent. Tertiaries are straight, the angle with the secondaries is ca. 90°. They stand oblique to the primary, the angle decreasing towards the apex. They are densely placed, distance less than 5 mm. Some veins of the 4th order could be observed. Cuticle: difficult to prepare, very thin; some 4-celled glandular hairbases, typical for Alnus could be observed. The stomata are anomocytic, 25–30 μm long, 22–25 μm wide. The epidermal cells are penta–hexagonal with straight walls. A hair base measured ca. 20 μm across and was surrounded by thickened cells. This material is comparable with that, described by Belz as Alnus incana . In older literature similar material is referred to as Carpiniphyllum caudatum Reymann ( Reymann, 1912 ; Kräusel, 1919 ; Kownas, 1955 ). Ecology : this species requires a lime-rich, light soil with a good drainage; unit 5. Alnus tanaitica Dorofeev fruits ( Plate I , 1) Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 14149, 14375, 14376, 14377, 14378, 14379, 14380, 14381, 14382, 14383, 14384, 14385, 14386, 17646, 17647, 17648, 18169, 18170.

The structure is woody, often with some longitudinal furrows. Size: length 2–2.4 mm, width 1.2–2 mm. The material is comparable with that described by Mai and Walther (1988) as A. tanaitica . Ecology The material is similar to the nutlets of A. incana , but the material of the pure alder wetland forest and that of sample 18169, taken from an assemblage with dominant A. cecropiaefolia , contains the same type of nutlets. Therefore the material is considered to be typical for wetland alder forest; unit 3. Apium repens (Jacquin) Lagasca et Segura fruits (Plate I, 3, 4) Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 14375, 14376, 14377, 14378, 14379, 14380, 14381, 14383, 14386, 17647, 17648, 18179. Remarks : The fruits are small, 1.2–1.5 by 0.7–0.9 mm, consisting of 2 one-seeded parts. The fruits bear on the outer side 5 ribs, between which are 4 glossy bands.

Caldesia cylindrica (Reid) Dorofeev seed Material studied : coll. no. 14375. Ecology : This is a species from the reed vegetation along alkaline and nutrient-rich water courses; unit 2. Caricoidea jugata (Nikitin ex Dorofeev) Mai fruits Material studied : coll. no. 14381. Ecology : The genus is known from clays and browncoal deposits, therefore it is considered to belong to units 3, 9. Carex acutiformis Ehrhart fruits Material studied : coll. no. 14149, 14378, 18170. Ecology : This plant, growing on nutrient-rich and alkaline soils, is a species of streamsides and wetland forest, e.g. alder forest; units 2, 3. Carex appropinquata Schumacher fruits (Plate I, 8) Material studied : coll. no. 14379, 14380, 14381, 14383. Remarks : The nutlets of this species measure (1.6–2)×(1.2–1.4) mm. They are biconvex with a very fine cellular pattern. The shape is circular to ovate with rounded base and apex. The greatest width is in the middle of the nutlet, a style base is present. Ecology : This material is comparable with that of the recent C. appropinquata Schumacher. This species requires a constant supply of nutrient-rich water, it is a plant of streamside vegetation on alkaline soil; unit 2. Carex cespitosa L. fruits (Plate I, 17) Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 14375, 14378, 14379, 14380, 14381, 14382, 14383, 17646, 17647, 17648, 18169, 18170. Remarks : Size: length ca. 1.4 mm, width 1.2 mm. In this species the cellular pattern is somewhat coarser and more easily observed than in the foregoing species. The nuts are also biconvex and circular to oval in shape, but the base is narrower, the style is very short. Ecology : The recent species grows on nutrient-rich and alkaline but lime-free, peat-soil in streamside vegetation and alder forest; however, the complete absence of the material in the pure alder wetland forest points to a restriction to unit 2. Carex elongatoides Lancucka-Srodoniowa fruits (Plate I, 11) Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 14375, 14376, 14378, 14379, 14380, 14381, 14382, 14383, 14384, 17646. Remarks : The material consists of flattened biconvex nutlets with a rounded elongate shape and a very fine cellular pattern. The length is 1.5–1.7 mm and the width 0.6–0.8 mm, the greatest width being in the middle of the nutlet.

Carex helmensis Mai et Walther fruits (Plate I, 12) Material studied : coll. no. 14377, 18169, 18170. Remarks : This species has flattened biconvex nutlets. The surface shows a coarse cellular pattern. The base is narrow. Size: length 1.8–2.2 mm, width 1.2–1.4 mm. Although these measurements are slightly larger than those of the type material ( Mai and Walther, 1988 ), this material is assigned to C. helmensis .

The measurements are: length 2–3 mm; width 1.2–1.8 mm. These fruits are similar to those of the recent Oenanthe lachenalii and agree with the description by Mai and Walther (1988) . Ecology : This is a plant of reed vegetations on wet, temporarily inundated alkaline and nutrient-rich clay; unit 2. Populus sp. leaves (Plate V, 2; Plate VI, 4) Material studied : coll. no. 12677, 12681, 12692, 12699.

These are irregular, isodiametric to elongate polygonal cells with sinuate walls. Diameter 15–25 μm. Stomata brachyparacytic, with striae over the accessory cells; length 28–35 μm, width 15–20 μm. Stomatal slit 26–33 μm long, narrowed at the extremities. Guard cells with a thickened inner wall. This cuticle matches that of P. alba so that the material can be assigned to this species. Ecology : P. alba requires a lime-rich, humid soil, which only dries out superficially during the growing season; unit 5.

Pterocarya paradisiaca (Unger) Iljinskaja leaves (Plate IV, 2) Material studied : coll. no. 12640, 12643, 12647, 12658, 12663, 12679, 17951, 17956. Ecology : As this genus is known to thrive under wet conditions, inhabiting swampy sites, it is considered to be a plant of the wetland forest; unit 3. Quercus pseudocastanea Goeppert leaves Material studied : coll. no. 12644, 12654. Ecology : The nearest living relative is Quercus petraea (Mattuschka) Liebl. This is a tree of rather acidic loamy soils. It requires a rather humid atmosphere; unit 6. Ranunculus repens L. (Plate II, 6), fruits Material studied : coll. no. 18170.

It prefers streamside vegetation and willow floodplain forest; units 2–5. Rubus fruticosus L. endocarps (Plate II, 7, 8) Material studied : coll. no. 14149, 14378, 14379, 14380, 14381, 14382, 14383, 14384, 14385, 14386, 17646, 17648, 18169, 18170. Remarks : These endocarps are flattened and the reticulum is rather coarse and deep. The measurements are: length 2–2.5 mm, width 0.6–1.5 mm. They can be partly identified as R. polevskoyanus Dorofeev ( Dorofeev, 1970 ; Mai and Walther, 1988 ), partly as R. fruticosus , partly as neither of these. As it is clear, that it is impossible to decide between these species, the material is described as R. fruticosus , while this is already an aggregate species. Ecology : this species prefers a rather nitrogen-poor, acidic soil, preferably in forest; units 3–7. Rumex sp. fruits ( Plate III , 7) Material studied : coll. no. 14383, 18169.

Remarks : The U shaped seedcoats of this species are similar to those of Alisma plantago-aquatica but differ in their size. They are over 2 mm long and the two straight parts are of unequal length. They are comparable to those of Sagittaria sagittifolia L. and agree with the description in Mai and Walther (1988) . Ecology : These plants are standing in water all year round, up to a depth of 1 m; the water may be stagnant or flowing, carbonate-rich, rather nutrient-rich on mineral soil; unit 2. Salix sp. seeds (Plate II, 14, 15) Material studied : coll. no. 18170. Remarks : These are tiny elliptical to oval seeds with a cellular surface pattern. They show a thin, not very clear raphesinus. They show some resemblance with S. repens L. Salix varians Goeppert leaves (Plate VI, 1, 2) Material studied : coll. no. 12651.

Leaf amphistomatic, epidermis cells isodiametric pentagonal, with straight walls, diameter 30–40 μm. Over the wider veins the epidermal cells are elongate and striate. Between them some hair bases are present: small thick walled cells with a diameter of 20–24 μm. The stomata are brachyparacytic, the guard cells are 32–44 μm long and ca. 12 μm wide; the stomatal slit is ca. 8 μm wide and up to 28 μm long. This material is comparable with that described by Mai and Walther (1988) and Belz (1992) as Salix varians . Ecology : Salix is common in the regularly inundated lower parts of well-drained floodplains; the genus being able to withstand rather strong currents; unit 5. Salvinia sp. macrosori (Plate II, 10) Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 14380, 14381, 14383. Remarks : These are small flattened globular bodies enclosing remains of trilete macrospores.

Sambucus pulchella Reid et Reid seeds (Plate III, 8) Material studied : coll. no. 14149, 14385, 14386, 17646. Remarks : These are small, black elliptical seeds with transverse wrinkles. Measurements: length 2–3 mm; breadth 1.2–1.5 mm. They agree with the descriptions by Reid and Reid (1915) and Mai and Walther (1988) . Ecology : Sambucus grows only on very nitrogen rich soils, the nitrogen derived either from flotsam or other organic source. The plant only flowers profusely in sunny positions. The absence from the samples with remains from as well allochthonous as autochthonous vegetations and the presence in pure alder wetland forest indicates, that the species was an integral part of the alder wetland forest; units 3–5. Scindapsites crassus (Reid et Reid) Gregor et Bogner seed Material studied : coll. no. 14383. Ecology : This genus is so far known as a plant from wet herbaceous vegetations; unit 2.

Ecology : Scirpus generally is a genus of moist places with herbaceous vegetation and therefore this species is considered a member of such reed vegetation; unit 2. Scirpus sp. fruit Material studied : coll. no. 17647. Remark : This material could only be determined to the generic level. Ecology : See the foregoing species; unit 2. Scirpus tabernaemontani C.

Solanum dulcamara L. seeds (Plate III, 2) Material studied : coll. no. 14378, 14379. Remarks : The campylotropous seeds agree with those of Solanum dulcamara in shape, size and reticular surface sculpture. Ecology : This species requires a nutrient-rich and carbonate-rich, wet to dry soil. It is an inhabitant of streamsides and forest borders (of alder forest in particular); however, the complete absence of the species in the pure alder wetland forest points to a restriction of the species to more open sites; unit 2. Sorbus aucuparia L. seeds Material studied : coll. no. 14132, 14378, 14379, 14381, 14383, 14384, 14385.

Remarks : The endocarps of this species, 2.8–3.5 mm long and 1.5–2.2 mm wide, have a very coarse surface with several wide longitudinal ribs. At the base is a circular groove, at the truncate apex sometimes a small, pointed stylar base is to be observed. They agree with the description of Mai and Walther (1988) .

In these strips of irregular thinwalled cells longitudinally orientated stomata present; these are 35–38 μm long and ca. 15 μm wide. This material can be compared with leaves and cuticle of Sparganium . However, the material and preservation did not allow a more detailed description, so no specific identification was possible.

Ecology : This is a plant of shallow to rather deep water, thriving in localities with contrasting circumstances, it does not stand up to strong wave action, but prefers quiet places with a muddy soil. The habitat must be rich in nutrients; unit 2. Ulmus pyramidalis Goeppert, leaves (Plate VI, 4a, 5) Material studied : coll. no. 12653, 12654, 12656, 12677, 12689, 17950, 17953, 17955.

Ecology : Moist forests and open habitats in oligotrophic environments, units 2, 3, 9. 4. Discussion It is possible to draw a number of interesting conclusions from a comparison of the megafossil and microfossil assemblages (see Table 2 ). On the one hand, the dominance of Alnus in the leaf- and diaspore assemblages, which is taken as evidence of an alder carr, is corroborated by the pollen record. Likewise, plants of reed and streamside vegetation are found in both the megafossil and microfossil assemblages. On the other hand, a number of qualitative and quantitative differences are apparent. Thus 56% of the seed plant families are only represented by either leaves/diaspores or pollen. This could mean any of a number of things ( Ferguson, 1995 ), e.g. (1) the dispersed organs are not all easily identified, (2) the plant parts display different potentials for fossilization, or (3) some of the plants did not grow close to the depositional area. The spheroidal, inaperturate pollen of Cupressaceae is difficult to differentiate from those of a number of other gymnosperms. On the other hand, Populus and Magnoliaceae pollen and those of many aquatic plants do not fossilize well. However, these two factors are not responsible for all the differences. The better representation in the pollen record of broad-leaved trees requiring good drainage point to an extra-local origin for (some of) these elements ( Potter, 1976 ). This could explain why Quercus is qualitatively and quantitatively better represented in the pollen record. However, judging from the presence of Tilia pollen, which is poorly dispersed ( Keatinge, 1982 ), these trees were probably growing on hammocks not far from the site of deposition. The lack of any megafossils of the Pinaceae, which also prefer well-drained sites, is noteworthy. As abscised cones and needles of the Pinaceae are only found close to their source, these would have little chance of being incorporated into the clastic sediments if the parent plants were growing on dunes. Pollen of the Empetraceae and Ericaceae could indicate that these shrubs played a part in the undergrowth of such pinewoods. On the other hand they could imply a certain amount of heathland vegetation. There is no sign of this in the megafossil record. The section through the 9 C clay bed ( Table 1 Table 2 , samples g–o, 14378–14386) reveals a difference between the lower three samples and the uppermost six samples ( Fig. 2 .) The samples g–i show a strictly local taphocoenosis of only 19 taxa. In these the species mostly occurring in wetland forest are dominant. In the upper part of the sequence, the flora is much more diverse. In addition to the species of the alder forest, several species of open grassland and especially reed marsh are present; one species has disappeared: Sambucus pulchella . Moreover a number of species from `floodplain forest' and even `upland forest' are present. The sediment is more silty, the macroscopical remains are scarce and in the uppermost sample ( Table 1 , o, 14378) the matrix is a sandy clay. Based on this a drowning of the site resulting in wetter conditions with a more open vegetation is postulated. The vegetation consisted of a mosaic of alder forest and reedmarsh. In this situation the river had easier access to the site and this resulted in the presence of several allochthonous floral elements. The uppermost two samples show the strongest allochthonous influence (greatest number of vegetational units represented). Furthermore, a slight reversion in the vegetational development is visible in sample 14382, resulting in a drier phase with codominance between `wetland forest' and `reedland vegetation'. This transition from a strictly local flora to a more diverse, allochthonously influenced one enables us to unravel the ecology of the individual taxa. From their presence in the alder forest, it is clear that Actinidia faveolata , Sambucus pulchella , and Sorbus aucuparia were inhabitants of the alder forest. Another interesting thing is that, based on their recent ecology, Carex cespitosa , Solanum dulcamara and Urtica dubia would be expected to be present in the alder forest, However, although regularly present in the section, they were absent from the pure alder forest. The presence of Spirematospermum wetzleri in pure alder forest as well as in somewhat more open habitats, together with larger numbers in these open reedland vegetation units points to an ecology, which centers on open reedmarsh vegetation. The carpological assemblages from samples of the base of the 9 C clay bed (nos. 14132, 17647, 17648, Table 1 , b–d) agree most with the assemblages of the middle part of the section ( Fig. 3 ). Once again the reedland vegetation dominated, although accompanied by some elements from floodplain forest ( Vitis sylvestris, Acer sp., Carpinus betulus ). So, despite the strongly autochthonous signature of these samples, one must conclude that these samples represent a more open vegetation. The carpological assemblages of the top of the 9 C clay bed (nos. 14375, 14376, 14377, 17646, Table 1 , r–u) display the best agreement with those from the top of the section, being much more diverse and in some cases strongly allochthonously influenced ( Fig. 3 ). The assemblage from the channel deposit (sample 14149) ( Table 1 , w) just below the onset of the Upper Brunssumian basal clay deposit shows a typical spectrum of an allochthonous assemblage: several (6) vegetation units are represented, and although vegetation units 2 and 3 (streamside vegetation and wetland-forest) dominate the sample, their dominance is not very great. The material contains some typical allochthonous influences, not found in the overlying clay bed, e.g. Glyptostrobus europaeus , Eucommia europaea , Nyssa disseminata , Sparganium noduliferum ( Fig. 3 ). The carpological assemblage from the 1982 leaf bed (sample 18169) closely resembles the carpocoenoses collected from the middle part of the section through the 9 C clay bed, although `Floodplain forest' is not present in sample 18169 ( Fig. 2 ). Once again local vegetation dominated. The similarity to the samples with only local vegetation in the lower part of the 1983 section (samples 14386–14384) is less marked, while our material contains many more open grass- and reedland vegetation elements ( Carex cespitosa , C. szaferi , Lycopus europaeus , Oenanthe lachenalii , Sparganium neglectum , Stachys palustris , Spirematospermum wetzleri , Urtica dubia ) ( Fig. 2 ). The resemblance to the assemblages from samples 14132, 17647 and 17648 ( Table 1 , b–d) from the basal part of the clay bed is also striking ( Fig. 3 ). The carpological signature of the leaf bed (sample 18170) ( Table 1 , v), collected in 1995 is different. The matrix consisted of a silt. The assemblage shows stronger allochthonous influences, e.g. it contains disseminules from at least 6 different vegetation units, including floodplain forest and upland forest. In agreement with this is the very strong dominance of reed vegetation. Although it was collected from the basal portion of the clay bed, its content is comparable with that of the uppermost part of the section of the clay bed collected in 1983 (sample 14378, 14379) and the other samples from the top of the clay bed ( Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 ; Table 1 , n, o, r–u). From the above it can be concluded that we are dealing with a river environment with various vegetational and sedimentological environments. The result is a series of clays, containing autochthonous assemblages, and silts or sandy clays with allochthonous elements. In the clays as well as in the silt leaf compressions were found. The assemblage in the clay horizon was probably only slightly influenced by the extra local vegetation (comparable to the middle part of the section 14386–14378); the silt assemblage was possibly derived from communities growing under wetter conditions, with direct river influence, hence the coarser sediment. During the analysis of these leaf compressions not only a difference between these two assemblages was found, but also a marked distinction with the accompanying carpological assemblages ( Fig. 4 ). The leaf assemblage from the clay bed displays a strong representation of leaves from the `floodplain forest', fewer from the `wetland forest' and a poor showing of `streamside vegetation' and `upland forest'. The leaves of Alnus cecropiaefolia virtually dominate the assemblage (62%). However, material from forest on somewhat higher, better drained alluvial soils is also important, consisting of some more species (at least 4) and constituting altogether 28% of the leaf compressions. This is in marked contrast to the composition of the fruit/seed assemblages from the same deposit. The latter is typically autochthonous, consisting of material of the local vegetation and its immediate surroundings. It consists of `open water vegetation', `streamside and reed vegetation', and `wetland forest vegetation'. The very fine clay points to quiet depositional circumstances, allowing for a dominance of the local vegetation which, judging from the numerous branches must have been a mixture of reedland and alder forest. As the flora of the better drained floodplain is not represented in the carpological material, one may assume, that this flora was extralocal with reference to our source locality. That certain taxa are only represented by leaves is due to the operation of different transport mechanisms (wind and water versus water), which causes the leaf compression flora to be more allochthonous than the carpological assemblage. The leaf compressions of the bed sampled in 1995 represent a different origin. Alnus cecropiaefolia is no longer dominant, but A. incana , a tree from the better drained and less often inundated floodplains. It dominates the leaf compression flora by attaining a percentage of 72%. The second most important community is the `streamside vegetation', here extremely rich in reeds. The `wetland forest' vegetation is only third in importance. The carpological material of this horizon also displays marked allochthonous influences as stated above, but the local reed vegetation dominates the assemblage. Some parallels can be found with the carpological and leaf assemblages collected in 1982: in both the leaf and carpological assemblages of 1995 the allochthonous element as well as the streamside vegetation element are better represented than in those from 1982. The better representation of the streamside vegetation element is explicable when this represented the local vegetation. Consequently the other elements (open water vegetation, diverse forest vegetations) must have arrived by transport. This is also the case in the leaf compression assemblage. The forest vegetation is strongly dominated by allochthonous elements; so again the leaf compression flora is more allochthonous than the carpocoenosis. This underscores the idea that the taphonomic history of leaves is different from that of seeds/fruits. The best fit for this flora is, as already mentioned, with the top of the sequence 14386–14378 and with the top clay sample 17646.
