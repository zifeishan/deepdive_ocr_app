Precipitation
patterns
in
the
Miocene
of
Central
Europe
and
the
development
of
continentality
The
graphical
regressions
shown
in
Fig.
1
indicate
that
the
gradient
of
regression
between
WMP
and
the
other
precipitation
parameters
is
steepest
in
Burdigalian
,
Serravallian
and
Messinian
data
sets
.
The
low
number
of
data
available
for
the
Burdigalian
stage
does
not
allow
for
further
interpretation
,
but
the
generally
increasing
gradient
in
post-Langhian
data
evidences
an
increase
in
seasonal
differentiation
of
precipitation
towards
a
more
pronounced
precipitation
peak
in
summer
.
On
the
other
hand
,
despite
high
absolute
values
for
summer
precipitation
and
a
high
correlation
coefficient
,
Langhian
data
show
the
lowest
regressional
gradient
,
reflecting
generally
humid
conditions
with
no
specific
wetter
or
drier
season
in
summer
.

Patterns
of
continentality
Continentality
is
defined
by
low
precipitation
and
strong
seasonality
of
temperature
.
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
3
reflect
the
history
of
continental
climate
in
central
Europe
by
showing
the
patterns
of
MART
and
MAP
,
both
as
palaeo-data
alone
and
as
differences
of
palaeo-minus-modern
data
.
Fig.
4
provides
patterns
of
WMP
that
indicate
the
course
of
the
development
of
summer
rain
.
The
mean
annual
range
of
temperature
(
MART
,
Fig.
2
)
is
lowest
during
Burdigalian
and
Langhian
in
Western
Europe
and
increases
beginning
with
the
Middle
Miocene
.
However
,
the
coastal
parts
of
the
continent
display
only
minor
changes
,
reflecting
a
persistent
low
seasonality
of
temperature
influenced
by
the
Atlantic
Ocean
.
This
pattern
is
the
first
evidence
for
a
Neogene
climatic
differentiation
between
oceanic
and
continental
climate
in
Europe
.
Due
to
the
buffering
effect
of
the
large
Paratethys
sea
,
temperatures
in
Eastern
Europe
also
remain
equable
at
least
until
the
Tortonian
(
Bruch
et
al.
,
2004
,
Bruch
et
al.
,
2006
and
Bruch
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
During
the
Miocene
,
MART
patterns
were
evidently
not
as
strictly
east
–
west
oriented
as
they
are
today
.
Miocene
precipitation
data
all
show
generally
humid
conditions
for
the
entire
Miocene
.
Besides
a
general
decrease
in
mean
annual
precipitation
(
MAP
,
Fig.
3
)
,
the
Langhian
and
Tortonian
appear
to
be
wetter
phases
compared
to
the
times
before
and
after
.
Moreover
,
a
progressive
spatial
differentiation
appears
in
the
late
Middle
Miocene
(
Serravallian
)
with
lower
precipitation
in
the
eastern
part
of
central
Europe
.
Summer
precipitation
(
WMP
,
Fig.
4
)
decreases
beginning
with
the
Middle
Miocene
,
and
all
stages
to
some
extent
show
a
longitudinal
differentiation
,
with
slightly
lower
values
in
eastern
Europe
.
This
trend
becomes
more
obvious
towards
the
Late
Miocene
and
is
the
most
prominent
observed
pattern
change
of
all
precipitation
parameters
studied
.
Beyond
changes
in
temperature
,
shifts
in
the
annual
distribution
of
precipitation
may
have
played
a
major
role
in
post-Langhian
climate
changes
.
The
differences
between
modern
and
palaeo-data
document
the
very
low
degree
of
change
in
precipitation
(
MAP
,
WMP
)
and
MART
during
the
Miocene
compared
to
the
transformations
that
occurred
post-Miocene
and
up
to
the
present
.
Although
absolute
values
are
clearly
changing
with
the
approach
of
the
Messinian
,
they
are
still
remote
from
the
modern
situation
.
3.3
.
Seasonality
gradients
To
aid
in
analysis
of
the
latitudinal
gradients
of
precipitation
and
MART
as
measures
of
continentality
,
fossil
climate
data
are
plotted
against
longitude
in
Fig.
5
,
while
correlation
coefficients
are
given
in
Table
2
.
Here
none
of
the
data
reveal
statistically
significant
longitudinal
gradients
.
Only
Messinian
and
Burdigalian
data
(
with
a
small
data
sample
)
show
a
correlation
between
longitude
and
WMP
,
and
Messinian
and
Serravallian
data
to
some
extent
with
MAP
.
The
lack
of
significant
correlation
between
longitude
and
MART
can
mainly
be
traced
to
the
aforementioned
buffering
effect
of
the
Paratethys
,
which
suppressed
any
development
towards
temperature
seasonality
in
the
Pannonian
Basin
.
Nevertheless
,
data
from
the
Messinian
stage
show
a
slight
,
although
not
statistically
significant
,
increase
in
MART
,
together
with
the
strongest
decrease
in
MAP
and
WMP
from
west
to
east
of
all
data
.
With
its
combination
of
characteristics
,
the
Messinian
stands
alone
as
the
only
stage
to
display
a
tendency
towards
higher
continentality
in
Eastern
Europe
.
All
other
Miocene
stages
show
either
no
longitudinal
changes
,
or
not
in
this
combination
.
In
short
,
evidence
for
continental
climate
in
Eastern
Europe
first
appears
with
the
Messinian
.

Discussion
4.1
.
Miocene
climate
To
date
,
interpretation
of
Miocene
climate
has
mainly
been
based
on
temperature
parameters
,
with
Miocene
rainfall
generally
described
in
terms
of
mean
annual
precipitation
.
The
current
study
relies
on
a
more
comprehensive
set
of
Miocene
precipitation
data
and
employed
more
precise
precipitation
parameters
.
On
the
whole
,
the
data
document
generally
humid
conditions
,
with
all
parameters
exceeding
present
values
.
General
climatic
development
over
time
can
be
summarised
as
follows
.
Langhian
data
show
very
high
humidity
,
with
a
peak
in
precipitation
that
does
not
match
summer
precipitation
and
therefore
occurred
other
than
in
summer
,
and
no
longitudinal
gradient
.
Serravallian
data
show
slightly
less
humid
conditions
,
evidence
of
a
summer
peak
in
precipitation
,
and
no
significant
longitudinal
gradient
.
Tortonian
data
evidence
slightly
higher
humidity
than
in
previous
times
with
increasing
evidence
of
a
summer
peak
in
precipitation
,
but
no
longitudinal
gradients
.
Messinian
data
evidence
less
humid
conditions
,
increasing
evidence
of
a
summer
peak
in
precipitation
,
and
first
evidence
of
longitudinal
gradients
in
WMP
and
MAP
.
This
succession
testifies
to
a
general
decrease
in
precipitation
since
the
Middle
Miocene
and
the
onset
of
continental
climate
conditions
in
Eastern
Europe
in
the
Late
Miocene
.
Beyond
the
general
decrease
in
MAP
,
the
Langhian
and
Tortonian
appear
to
have
been
wetter
than
the
stages
before
and
after
.
Wetter
conditions
during
the
Langhian
may
be
related
to
the
Mid
Miocene
Climatic
Optimum
(
MMCO
)
and
are
widely
discussed
in
the
literature
(
e.g.
,
Kürschner
et
al.
,
2008
,
Retallack
,
2009
,
Wan
et
al.
,
2009
and
You
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
It
is
worth
noting
for
general
discussion
of
MMCO
that
our
data
show
a
strong
annual
range
of
precipitation
in
central
Europe
together
with
the
highest
values
for
all
precipitation
parameters
,
reflecting
generally
very
humid
conditions
with
some
seasonality
,
but
without
a
precipitation
peak
during
summer
(
see
also
Böhme
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
prevalence
of
wetter
conditions
during
the
Tortonian
than
in
preceding
and
successive
stages
has
been
less
thoroughly
discussed
,
mainly
because
the
focus
so
far
has
been
on
comparing
Middle
and
Late
Miocene
conditions
and
on
the
general
decrease
in
humidity
.
Only
Böhme
et
al.
(
2008
,
and
2011-this
issue
)
describe
wetter
conditions
during
the
Tortonian
than
in
the
late
Serravallian
and
early
Messinian
,
based
on
a
study
of
herpetofauna
and
in
good
agreement
with
our
results
.
On
the
other
hand
,
their
data
indicate
lower
than
present
MAP
during
short-term
dryer
phases
,
where
our
data
do
not
confirm
such
low
values
for
any
of
the
parameters
analysed
.
This
may
reflect
the
challenge
of
reconstructing
very
dry
conditions
on
the
basis
of
plant
fossils
(
see
Böhme
et
al.
,
2006
and
Böhme
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
lack
of
fossil
floras
preserved
under
dry
conditions
causes
a
strong
bias
in
our
data
set
with
gaps
towards
southern
Europe
,
where
plant
proxy
data
are
available
only
from
moister
regions
of
Spain
(
NW
coast
)
and
Italy
(
N
Italy
)
.
Moreover
,
in
central
and
eastern
Europe
as
well
,
faunas
and
floras
usually
come
from
different
stratigraphic
levels
and
taphonomic
settings
.
It
may
well
be
that
our
data
lack
the
necessary
temporal
resolution
and
taphonomic
ability
to
detect
dry
events
that
would
support
the
results
of
Böhme
et
al.
(
2008
,
and
2011-this
issue
)
.
However
,
aside
from
the
probable
bias
between
faunal
and
floral
proxy
data
,
the
same
basic
signals
may
be
documented
by
both
studies
.
Not
only
the
more
humid
Tortonian
stage
,
but
also
an
increasing
aridification
prograding
from
eastern
Europe
as
well
,
as
postulated
by
Böhme
et
al.
(
2011-this
issue
)
,
is
confirmed
by
our
data
.
That
signal
is
revealed
in
our
data
with
especial
clarity
in
the
increasing
longitudinal
gradients
of
MAP
and
WMP
over
time
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Miocene
climatic
changes
after
MMCO
are
testified
in
our
data
set
by
three
major
factors
:
(
1
)
increasing
seasonality
of
temperature
,
(
2
)
changes
in
the
annual
distribution
of
precipitation
towards
a
precipitation
peak
in
summer
,
and
(

)
a
late
increase
of
longitudinal
gradients
of
precipitation
parameters
.
4.2

Landscape
opening
in
Europe
The
expansion
of
open
landscapes
during
the
Miocene
in
Europe
has
been
the
subject
of
widespread
and
sometimes
heated
debate
based
on
fossil
fauna
and
flora
.
Strömberg
et
al.
(
2007
)
provide
a
comprehensive
review
of
the
discussion
.
Large
mammal
data
speak
for
the
presence
of
open
environments
in
southern
Europe
since
the
early
Late
Miocene
(
e.g.
,
Agustí
et
al.
,
1999
and
Fortelius
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
However
,
those
data
mainly
confirm
mosaic
landscapes
with
open
forests
and
do
not
support
the
notion
of
vast
open
landscapes
(
van
Dam
and
Reichert
,
2009
;
and
references
herein
)
.
With
regard
to
plant
fossils
,
only
some
data
on
phytoliths
and
pollen
favour
grass-dominated
savannas
or
open
woodlands
.
Showing
that
such
habitats
were
widely
established
in
the
eastern
parts
of
southern
Europe
during
the
Late
Miocene
based
on
phytolith
analyses
,
Strömberg
et
al.
(
2007
)
propose
that
relatively
open
habitats
developed
in
Asia
Minor
beginning
already
in
the
Early
Miocene
.
For
Akgün
et
al.
(
2007
)
,
however
,
analysis
of
Anatolian
pollen
profiles
documents
increasing
abundance
of
open
vegetation
taxa
only
during
the
Tortonian
.
In
addition
,
Syabryaj
et
al.
(
2007
)
describe
the
vegetation
development
of
the
Ukrainian
plain
as
a
stepwise
opening
of
the
forests
,
with
the
first
steppe
grasslands
arising
during
the
early
Tortonian
(
Khersonian
)
and
expanding
considerably
during
late
Messinian
(
Pontian
)
.
The
same
pattern
of
development
with
an
onset
of
opening
of
vegetation
at
the
Khersonian
stage
is
observed
by
Shatilova
et
al.
(
2010
)
for
a
shallow-marine
succession
in
eastern
Georgia
.
Only
Kovar-Eder
et
al.
(
2008
)
provide
a
broader
view
of
the
European
vegetation
history
,
based
on
a
quantitative
analysis
of
a
huge
floristic
data
set
from
Europe
.
The
authors
summarise
that
for
the
Tortonian
,
“
first
records
of
xeric
grasslands
are
found
along
the
northern
margin
of
the
Black
Sea
”
,
whereas
during
the
Messinian
“
open
woodlands
increasingly
appeared
in
central
and
southern
parts
of
Italy
and
Greece
”
.
Those
patterns
are
in
agreement
with
our
observation
of
the
earliest
data
to
support
continental
climate
in
Eastern
Europe
during
the
Messinian
.
Our
data
can
not
be
correlated
with
an
onset
of
opening
of
vegetation
during
or
prior
to
the
Tortonian
.
Either
that
development
in
vegetation
is
not
related
to
the
climate
parameters
analysed
here
,
or
,
conceivably
other
maybe
non
climatic
parameters
played
a
role
,
as
discussed
controversially
by
various
authors
for
example
for
atmospheric
CO
2
concentration
(
e.g.
,
Pagani
et
al.
,
1999
,
Cowling
,
1999
and
Kürschner
et
al.
,
2008
)
or
for
the
coevolution
of
grasses
and
grazers
(
Retallack
,
2001
)
.
It
is
also
possible
that
the
implications
of
certain
taxa
as
evidence
for
dryness
and
openness
(
e.g.
,
Poaceae
and
Asteraceae
)
are
overestimated
by
qualitative
approaches
or
underestimated
by
our
method
due
to
the
usually
wide
climatic
ranges
of
these
taxa
.
Hence
,
our
data
may
lack
the
required
resolution
and/or
spatial
coverage
to
fully
decipher
the
influence
of
continentality
on
vegetation
and
to
correlate
climatic
and
vegetation
data
statistically
.
This
could
apply
especially
to
southern
and
Eastern
Europe
with
their
still
scanty
data
coverage
,
but
also
points
back
to
the
methodological
question
of
the
ability
of
plant
proxies
to
detect
dry
events
,
as
discussed
above
.
Nevertheless
,
climatic
data
that
can
quantify
continentality
are
a
valuable
basis
for
explaining
the
expansion
of
grassland
in
Eurasia
.
Further
studies
on
a
broader
geographic
scale
,
with
an
enhanced
focus
on
southern
Europe
and
central
Eurasia
,
will
aid
in
quantifying
the
development
of
precipitation
patterns
and
understanding
their
influence
on
the
history
of
landscape
opening
during
the
Neogene
.
