Permineralized

give
clues
of
the
composition
of
forests
established

in

Central
America
Abstract
Central
American
rainforests
are
among
the
most
diverse
biomes
in
the
world
today
.
However
,
we
know
little
about
their
history
because
of
a
poor
fossil
record
.
Here
,
we
augment
previous
studies
based
on
fossil
pollen
of
Panama
with
an
investigation
of
eight
species
of
endocarps
and
seeds
from
an
upper
Eocene
locality
near
Tonosí
on
the
Pacific
coast
of
central
Panama
.
Affinities
at
the
family/order
level
include
:
Arecaceae
,
Vitaceae
,
Humiriaceae
,
Anacardiaceae
,
and
Lamiales
.
Biogeographically
,
two
of
the
Tonosí
fossil
taxa
,
Dracontomelon
and
cf.
Leea
,
are
interesting
because
they
occur
today
only
in
lowland
rainforests
of
the
Old
World
.
The
new
fossil
genus
Saxuva
,
together
with
cf.
Leea
,
are
the
earliest
evidence
of
Vitaceae
(
the
grape
family
)
in
the
Neotropics
.
The
new
genus
Lacunofructus
is
the
oldest
record
for
Humiriaceae
and
supports
the
previously
suggested
Neotropical
origin
for
the
family
.
We
interpret
the
Tonosí
macroflora
as
a
record
of
the
vegetation
which
colonized
land
that
emerged
as
part
of
the
Eocene
volcanic
arc
in
southern
Central
America
.

Introduction
Central
American
rainforests
are
noted
for
their
extraordinary
plant
diversity
,
family
composition
,
and
climate
(
Phillips
et
al.
,
2002
)
.
Except
for
few
reports
of
pollen
assemblages
(
Germeraad
et
al.
,
1968
and
Graham
,
1985
)
and
one
species
of
endocarp
(
Berry
,
1918
)
from
the
Eocene
of
Panama
;
few
data
have
been
available
on
the
plants
that
inhabited
the
earliest
terranes
of
Central
America
during
the
Paleogene
.
When
did
rainforests
first
become
established
in
Central
America
?
What
families
first
colonized
the
emergent
land
in
the
Panamanian
seaway
?
These
questions
are
difficult
to
address
without
a
sufficient
paleobotanical
record
.
The
rise
of
the
southern
part
of
Central
America
(
from
Nicaragua
to
Panama
)
has
been
hypothesized
as
a
result
of
a
volcanic
arc
that
started
no
earlier
than
the
middle
Miocene
(
~
17
Ma
)
(
see
review
in
Molnar
,
2008
)
.
Nevertheless
,
new
and
abundant
field
,
geochronological
,
and
thermochronological
data
from
Central
Panama
suggest
the
presence
of
large
volcanic
terranes
above
sea
level
at
least
since
the
Eocene
(
Fig.

;
Iturralde-Vinent
,
2006
,
Buchs
et
al.
,
2011
and
Montes
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
Given
the
complex
geological
history
of
Central
America
and
especially
in
Panama
(
Wegner
et
al.
,
2011
)
,
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
earliest
forests
in
those
Eocene
terranes
evolved
in
parallel
to
the
tectonics
of
the
region
,
where
long-distance
dispersal
,
island-hopping
,
and
vicariance
might
have
played
an
important
role
for
the
colonization
of
the
new
land
.
Recent
discoveries
of
macrofloras
from
the
middle
to
upper
Paleocene
of
Colombia
(
Doria
et
al.
,
2008
,
Herrera
et
al.
,
2008
,
Herrera
et
al.
,
2011
,
Gómez-Navarro
et
al.
,
2009
,
Wing
et
al.
,
2009
and
Carvalho
et
al.
,
2011
)
have
provided
evidence
of
the
earliest
Neotropical
rainforests
,
similar
to
biomes
from
this
region
in
leaf
morphology
,
family
composition
,
and
inferred
climatic
conditions
.
However
,
the
Paleocene
plant
diversity
was
much
lower
than
in
modern
tropical
counterparts
.
Plant
diversity
similar
to
or
even
higher
than
extant
Neotropical
levels
is
first
observed
during
the
warmest
periods
of
the
Cenozoic
in
northern
South
America
:
the
Paleocene
–
Eocene
boundary
and
the
early-middle
Eocene
(
Jaramillo
et
al.
,
2006
and
Jaramillo
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
High
temperatures
and
wet
conditions
,
in
correlation
with
high
levels
of
atmospheric
CO
2
,
seem
to
be
some
of
the
main
reasons
for
the
elevated
levels
of
plant
diversity
recorded
globally
in
the
Eocene
(
Graham
,
1994
and
Zachos
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
New
localities
from
the
Paleogene
of
Central
America
are
important
for
the
understanding
of
the
evolution
,
diversity
,
and
composition
of
the
earliest
forests
in
the
region
before
the
final
closing
of
the
Panamanian
seaway
during
the
Neogene
(
Coates
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
Here
,
we
report
new
permineralized
fossil
endocarps
and
seeds
from
an
upper
Eocene
locality
from
the
Pacific
coast
of
Panama
near
Tonosí
.
A
fossil
layer
first
reported
by
Berry
(
1918
)
was
relocated
and
seven
of
the
eight
taxa
reported
here
are
new
fossil
species
.
These
fossils
provide
insight
into
the
families
and
genera
typical
of
lowland
rainforests
in
the
earliest
terranes
of
Central
America
.
Also
,
two
of
the
new
fossil
species
belong
to
modern
genera
that
today
grow
only
in
lowland
rainforests
of
Africa
,
Southeast
Asia
,
and
Australasia
.

.
The
paleobotanical
potential
of
the
Tonosí
area
was
first
recognized
by
Berry
(
1918
)
with
the
publication
of
a
single
plant
species
that
he
assigned
to
the
modern
genus
Diospyros
.
The
type
specimen
,
originally
collected
by
D.F.
MacDonald
,
contains
several
conspecific
permineralized
fruits
.
A
visit
to
the
mouth
of
the
Tonosí
River
in
the
summer
of
2007
allowed
us
to
relocate
the
fossiliferous
layer
.
After
two
more
visits
in
the
summers
of
2010
and
2011
more
than
70
specimens
of
calcium
carbonate-permineralized
endocarps
and
seeds
have
been
collected
.
The
plant
remains
come
from
the
Búcaro
Formation
,
and
are
found
in
blue-green
calcareous
fine-grained
sandstone
and
siltstones
with
abundant
molluscan
fossils
.
The
stratigraphy
of
the
Tonosí
area
shows
an
intercalation
of
widespread
basalts
,
calcareous
sandstones
,
conglomerates
,
and
shales
,
many
of
these
beds
also
containing
abundant
invertebrate
faunas
and
carbonized
and
calcified
wood
.
The
Tonosí
strata
have
been
suggested
to
be
among
the
oldest
sedimentary
sequences
in
Panama
(
Vaughan
,
1919
)
;
several
historical
studies
of
the
invertebrate
faunas
(
mollusk
and
foraminifera
)
propose
an
early
late
Eocene
age
for
this
sequence
(
Miller
and
Furnish
,
1939
and
Olsson
,
1942
)
based
on
correlations
with
the
Eocene
Talara
Formation
from
Peru
.
A
more
recent
study
based
on
foraminifera
from
the
Azuero
Peninsula
corroborates
a
late
Eocene
age
for
the
shallow
sedimentary
sequences
from
Tonosí
(
Baumgartner-Mora
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
Transverse
(
cut
perpendicular
to
longest
axis
of
the
specimen
)
and
longitudinal
(
cut
parallel
to
the
longest
axis
of
the
specimen
)
sections
were
cut
through
the
center
of
the
fossils
with
a
thin-bladed
diamond
saw
;
subsequently
the
specimens
were
photographed
while
immersed
in
xylene
or
low-viscocity
resin
(
Opticon
No.
224
)
to
highlight
their
internal
anatomy
.
Acetate
peels
of
the
fossil
plants
were
prepared
using
the
technique
of
Joy
et
al.
(
1956
)
.
Sectioned
specimens
were
first
polished
with
an
aqueous
slurry
of
silicon
carbide
grit
(
600
)
on
a
glass
plate
and
then
etched
in
5
%
HCl
for
five
seconds
.
After
etching
,
the
specimens
were
carefully
washed
with
tap
water
and
allowed
to
dry
.
Then
,
the
etched
surface
was
flooded
with
acetone
and
a
strip
of
cellulose
acetate
was
placed
over
it
.
The
peels
were
air-dried
for
about
20
min
and
then
the
acetate
was
gently
peeled
away
by
hand
,
trimmed
with
scissors
,
and
mounted
on
a
glass
slide
with
Canada
balsam
mounting
medium
.

genera
of

The
combination
of
characters
such
as
longitudinal
striations
,
the
embryo
scar
,
a
thick
seed
coat
,
and
a
strongly
ruminate
endosperm
support
the
placement
of
this
fossil
taxon
within
the
Arecaceae
(
Dransfield
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
Ruminate
seeds
are
also
found
in
other
families
(
Bayer
and
Appel
,
1996
)
,
for
example
in
Annonaceae
,
however
its
seeds
are
bisymmetrical
unlike
the
Panamanian
fossil
.
Another
example
is
Myristicaceae
,
however
,
the
ruminate
endosperm
in
seeds
of
that
family
extends
radially
inward
nearly
to
the
center
of
the
seed
(
Doyle
et
al.
,
2008
)
;
in
our
fossil
the
ruminations
are
only
superficial
intrusions
of
the
seed
coat
and
lack
the
radial
pattern
seen
in
Myristicaceae
.
A
survey
of
extant
seeds
in
the
Arecaceae
shows
that
the
combination
of
characters
present
in
this
fossil
occurs
in
several
genera
,
including
for
example
Bismarckia
,
Ptychococcus
,
Roystonea
,
and
Tahina
.
This
occurrence
of
rumination
seems
to
be
highly
homoplasious
as
it
appears
in
several
unrelated
clades
of
the
family
(
Dransfield
et
al.
,
2008
)
;
therefore
,
we
can
not
attribute
this
fossil
to
a
particular
genus
or
tribe
.
No
other
fossil
previously
related
to
Arecaceae
(
see
review
in
Harley
,
2006
)
preserves
all
the
characters
observed
in
the
Panamanian
specimens
.

Description
—
Half
of
a
seed
preserved
in
lateral
view
(
Plate
II
,
1
)
.
Length
~
6.9
mm
and
width
~
5.7
mm
.
Seed
coat
very
thin
,
~
80
μm
in
thickness
.
The
seed
coat
covers
a
corrugated
surface
with
a
series
of
ridges
that
correspond
to
the
rugae
.
From
these
rugae
,
a
lateral
,
c-shaped
ruga
runs
basally
,
more
or
less
parallel
to
the
dorsal
side
of
the
seed
and
several
rugae
depart
from
it
at
approximately
right
and
obtuse
angles
and
bifurcate
(
Plate
II
,
1
)
.
The
seed
also
preserves
vascular
strands
that
run
along
the
crests
of
rugae
(
Plate
II
,
2
)
.
The
transverse
sections
of
the
specimen
(
Plate
II
,
3
–
6
)
reveal
that
the
seed
was
filled
with
sediment
,
however
,
internal
remains
of
what
appears
to
be
the
dorsal
infold
and
the
longitudinally
arranged
rugae
are
still
preserved
(
Plate
II
,
3
–
6
)
.
On
the
dorsal
side
there
are
two
intrusions
of
the
seed
coat
;
they
appear
broken
,
but
might
represent
the
bases
of
the
Y-shaped
dorsal
infold
.
Other
remains
of
the
longitudinal
grooves
are
also
preserved
,
supporting
the
branching
pattern
observed
on
the
lateral
view
(
Plate
II
,
3
–
6
)
.
Systematic
affinity
—
The
genus
Leea
of
the
grape
family
(
Vitaceae
)
shows
the
closest
similarity
to
this
fossil
.
Extant
species
of
Leea
(
Plate
II
,
7
–
9
)
are
recognized
by
seeds
with
a
long
chalaza
on
the
dorsal
side
,
a
Y-shaped
dorsal
infold
(
seen
in
transverse
section
)
,
a
pair
of
ventral
infolds
,
and
a
pair
of
longitudinally
arranged
rugae
on
each
of
the
lateral
faces
(
representing
lateral
infolds
)
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,

)
.
This
fossil
is
an
incomplete
cast
(
infilling
of
the
seed
coat
)
,
with
some
patches
of
remaining
seed
coat
,
interpreted
to
represent
a
seed
that
had
split
open
in
the
plane
of
bisymmetry
.
Important
characters
,
including
the
chalaza
and
ventral
infolds
,
can
not
be
seen
due
to
the
fragmentary
,
incomplete
nature
of
the
single
specimen
,
but
the
portion
preserved
closely
resembles
the
ornamentation
seen
in
some
species
of
Leea
,
e.g.
,
L
.
philippinensis
Merrill
(
Plate
II
,
7
)
and
L
.
heterodoxa
Schumann
and
Lauterbach
.
The
fossil
shows
a
series
of
highly
branched
furrows
,
developed
from
the
longitudinally
arranged
ruga
and
internal
remains
of
what
appear
to
be
the
Y-shaped
dorsal
infold
(
Plate
II
,
3
–
6
)
;
these
two
characters
are
distinctive
for
extant
Leea
(
Plate
II
,
8
,
9
)
and
set
the
genus
apart
from
other
Vitaceae
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2011
)
.
Thus
,
based
on
the
presence
of
these
characters
,
we
support
the
placement
of
the
Panamanian
fossil
within
this
Paleotropical
and
Australasian
genus
.
However
,
we
hope
to
find
more
complete
specimens
as
collecting
efforts
at
the
Tonosí
locality
continue
,
to
fully
observe
the
chalaza
and
ventral
infolds
.
Modern
Leea
grows
mostly
in
lowland
to
montane
forests
from
Malaysia
,
Indochina
,
South
and
Southwest
China
,
and
India
,
extending
to
Micronesia
,
Melanesia
,
Australia
,
and
tropical
Africa
(
Wen
,
2007
)
.
Given
this
exclusively
Old
World
distribution
of
its
extant
species
,
the
occurrence
of
Leea
fossils
in
Central
America
might
seem
unexpected
.
However
,
fossil
seeds
of
the
same
genus
have
also
been
recognized
on
the
basis
of
better-preserved
and
more
complete
specimens
from
the
Paleogene
Belén
flora
of
Peru
.
The
specimens
from
Belén
described
as
Carpolithus
olssoni
Berry
(
1927
)
were
identified
as
Leea
by
Chen
and
Manchester
(
2007
)
.
The
age
of
the
Belén
locality
was
formerly
considered
to
be
Eocene
;
however
a
recent
visit
to
the
original
site
recovered
diatoms
from
the
seed-bearing
layer
that
lead
us
to
infer
a
younger
,
latest
early
Oligocene

and
a

These

only
)
extending
apically
beyond
the

(
Plate

.
Ventral

are
bordered
by
thin
and
sharply
pointed
lateral
edges
,
with
a
maximum

mm
;
these
ventral
cavities
appear
in
two
successive
transverse

,
thus
we
estimate
a

Transverse

configuration
of

(

in
two
apical

;
Plate

the
endosperm
area
protrudes
the
endotesta
.
Endotesta
is
variable
in
thickness
--
very
thick
at
the
chalaza-raphe
areas
(
0.4
–
2.0
mm
)
and
at
the
sharp
lateral
edges
of
the
ventral
cavities
(
1.5
–
2.3
mm
;
Plate

The

is
formed
by
three
layers
of
isodiametric
and
anisodiametric
cells
(
Plate

–
20
)
;
these
layers
are
usually
well
preserved
in
the
ventral
,
raphe
and
chalaza
areas
.
By
the
ventral
faces
the
endotesta
is
very
thin
and
shows
only
two
layers
of
parenchyma
cells
;
the
outermost
layer
shows
square
parenchyma
cells
~
27
to
23
μm
(
Plate
III
,
19
)
,
the
innermost
layer
(
in
contact
with
the
endosperm
cavity
)
is
formed
by
columnar
cells
~
68
μm
in
length
and
~
16
μm
in
width
,
this
layer
is
not
well
preserved
in
the
raphe
,
chalaza
and
lateral
edges
of
the
ventral
cavities
(
Plate

A
third
,
almost
undefined
layer
of
thick-walled
anisodiametric
cells
(
ranging
from
25
to
117
μm
in

is
present
in
the
borders
of
the
raphe

Derivation
of
specific
epithet
—
From
the
fictional
character
Count
Dracula
,
making
reference
to
the
vampire/bat

as
viewed
in
transverse
sections
(

)
.
Systematic
affinity
—
Saxuva
draculoidea
presents
a
dorsal
chalaza
and
paired
ventral
infolds
,
two
characters
diagnostic
of
the
grape
family
--
Vitaceae
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2007
and
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2011
)
.
Other
characters
consistent
with
Vitaceae
that
are
preserved
in
these
fossils
include
the
basal
beak
,
the
ruminate
and
m-shaped
endosperm
cavity
(
seen
in
transverse
sections
)
,
and
the
lignified
endotesta
(
Plate
III
,
1
–
20
)
.
Within
Vitaceae
,
S
.
draculoidea
resembles
modern
taxa
within
the
genera
that
possess
a
long
,
linear
chalaza
,
correlating
mostly
with
the
clade
having
tetramerous
flowers
(
Wen
et
al.
,
2007
,
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2011
and
Ren
et
al.
,
2011
)
.
It
is
readily
distinguished
from
most
members
the
pentamerous
clade
including
Vitis
,
Ampelopsis
,
Ampelocissus
,
and
Parthenocissus
,
by
the
linear
,
rather
than
circular
to
oval
,
chalazal
scar
.
Although
some
species
within
the
tetramerous
clade
vary
by
having
oval
chalazas
instead
,
its
presence
may
be
a
derived
condition
(
Chen
,
2009
)
.
The
new
fossil
taxon
exhibits
characters
seen
in
the
modern
genera
Cissus
,
Cayratia
,
and
Cyphostemma
.
Cissus
is
the
largest
genus
in
the
family
,
with
ca.
350
species
(
Lombardi
,
2007
and
Chen
,
2009
)
.
Its
seeds
can
be
smooth
(
Plate
III
,
1
,
21
)
or
rugose
,
the
opening
of
the
ventral
infolds
on
the
seed
surface
are
linear
or
wide
(
Plate
III
,
11
,
24
)
,
and
occasionally
the
endotesta
appears
exceptionally
thickened
near
the
chalaza
,
(
Plate
III
,
11
,
17
,
22
,
23
)
,
raphe
(
Plate
III
,
16
,
27
)
,
and
lateral
edges
(
Plate
III
,
4
,
11
,
25
)
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2011
)
.
Also
,
we
observe
in
the
endotesta
of
the
fossil
and
several
extant
species
of
Cissus
,
an
undefined
,
outermost
layer
of
thick-walled
anisodiametric
cells
toward
the
raphe
and
chalaza
(
Plate
III
,
16
,
17
,
23
,
27
)
.
Transverse
sections
above
the
opening
of
the
ventral
infold
slits
in
extant
Cissus
also
show
the
lemniscate-shaped
structure
(
∞
)
formed
by
the
endosperm
cavity
(
Plate
III
,
8
,
9
,
13
,
26
)
;
nevertheless
,
this
character
seems
to
be
common
across
some
other
genera
in
the
family
,
including
Cayratia
and
Cyphostemma
as
well
.
Saxuva
draculoidea
fits
partially
within
the
natural
morphological
variation
observed
in
Cissus
(
Plate
III
,
21
–
27
)
.
However
,
Saxuva
preserves
what
appears
to
be
a
circular
vascular
strand
wrapped
inside
the
endotesta
(
Plate
III
,
12
,
16
,
18
)
,
this
character
has
been
observed
only
in
species
of
Cyphostemma
so
far
(
Plate
III
,
29
,
30
)
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2011
)
.
Significant
morphological
differences
between
Saxuva
and
Cyphostemma
lie
in
the
presence
of
closed
ventral
infolds
and
a
strongly
rugulate
seed
surface
in
the
extant
genus
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2011
)
.
Cayratia
also
has
some
seeds
that
resemble
S.
draculoidea
(
i.e.
long
and
linear
chalaza
,
wide
opening
of
the
ventral
infolds
,
thick
endotesta
,
and
a
smooth
dorsal
surface
)
(
Plate
III
,
28
)
.
Cayratia
seeds
display
more
morphological
variation
compared
to
Cissus
,
but
that
morphological
range
does
not
seem
to
include
the
form
exhibited
by
this
fossil
species
.
Due
to
the
notable
differences
between
S.
draculoidea
and
the
mentioned
extant
genera
,
we
consider
this
genus
to
be
of
uncertain
placement
within
the
tetramerous
flower
clades
in
Vitaceae
.
No
other
fossil
assigned
to
Vitaceae
shows
all
the
characters
observed
in
S
.
draculoidea
.
Extant
Cissus
has
a
Pantropical
distribution
and
Cayratia
,
and
Cyphostemma
are
restricted
to
the
Old
World
(
Wen
et
al.
,
2007
and
Ren
et
al.
,
2011
)
.
In
the
Neotropics
,
three
other
genera
also
co-occur
today
with
Cissus
:
Ampelocissus
,
Ampelopsis
,
and
Vitis
,
ranging
from
lowland
to
high
mountain
forests
(
Lombardi
,
2007
)
.
Although
Ampelocissus
and
Leea
are
known
from
the
Oligocene
of
Belén
,
Peru
(
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2007
)
,
the
antiquity
of
Ampelopsis
and
Vitis
in
Central
and
South
America
remains
unknown
.
The
new
fossil
genus
Saxuva
and
the
above-described
specimen
of
cf.
Leea
(
Plate
II
,
1
–
6
)
are
the
earliest
evidence
of
the
grape
family
in
the
Neotropics
.
Vitaceae
are
of
interest
for
their
basal
position
within
Rosids
,
one
of
the
largest
clades
in
flowering
plants

Derivation

Jose

who
studied
Humiriaceae
intensively
.
Systematic
affinity
—
Fruits
of
Humiriaceae
have
woody
endocarps
with
a
central
vascular
axis
,
up
to
10
carpels
,
mostly
one
seed
per
locule
,
and
are
readily
recognizable
by
their
distinctive
germination
valves
(
Plate
IV
,
8
–
12
;
Herrera
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
Several
genera
in
the
family
,
of
which
Sacoglottis
is
perhaps
the
best-known
example
(
Plate
IV
,
11
,
12
)
,
also
have
cavities
in
the
wall
that
have
been
referred
to
in
the
literature
as
resin
or
oil
cavities
(
Cuatrecasas
,
1961
)
.
Lacunofructus
cuatrecasana
presents
a
set
of
characters
diagnostic
for
the
family
;
however
,
the
combination
of
characters
does
not
coincide
with
that
of
any
single
modern
genus
.
In
most
of
its
morphological
characters
,
this
fossil
species
conforms
most
closely
to
the
modern
genus
Vantanea
,
except
for
one
conspicuous
difference
--
the
absence
of
wall
cavities
in
extant
species
of
the
genus
(
Plate
IV
,
8
–
10
;
Herrera
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
Such
cavities
within
the
endocarp
wall
and
septa
are
hypothesized
to
have
evolved
independently
several
times
in
the
family
(
Herrera
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
It
is
possible
that
ancestral
Vantanea
species
retained
or
developed
these
cavities
and
subsequently
lost
them
(
in
which
case
our
fossil
could
be
attributed
to
the
genus
)
,
but
we
consider
it
more
likely
that
their
presence
in
the
Panamanian
fossil
indicates
an
extinct
genus
,
convergent
in
other
endocarp
characters
with
Vantanea
.
The
only
fossil
species
of
Humiriaceae
that
resembles
Lacunofructus
cuatrecasana
is
Vantanea
cipaconensis
(

;
however
,
this
fossil
taxon
has
a
median
furrow
on
the

of
the

and
lacks
the

Systematic
affinity
—
Berry
(
1918
)
originally
reported
three
specimens
(
Plate
V
,
1
)
of
this
taxon
that
he
assigned
to
Diospyros
of
the
family
Ebenaceae
.
Reexamination
and
sectioning
of
Berry
's
type
material
and
of
the
newly
collected
specimens
allowed
us
to
describe
this
taxon
in
more
detail
and
also
to
reassess
its
taxonomic
affinity
.
Although
in
Ebenaceae
there
are
drupes
with
valvate
endocarps
(
although
not
in
Diospyros
)
,
the
affinity
with
this
family
can
be
ruled
out
based
on
the
absence
of
lacunae
,
endocarp
wall
apertures
,
and
the
valve
morphology
observed
in
modern
Anacardiaceae
.
Within
Anacardiaceae
the
fossil
endocarps
resemble
most
genera
of
the
Spondioideae
subfamily
(
Plate
V
,
19
–
21
)
,
i.e.
,
fibrous
endocarps
with
a
relatively
thick
exocarp
,
often
multilocular
with
single
seeded
locules
,
radially
arranged
,
typically
having
elliptical
germination
pores
near
the
apex
of
each
locule
,
and
sometimes
with
specialized
opercula
(
Grote
,
1989
and
Mitchell
et
al.
,
2006
;
Mitchell
,
J.D.
,
Daly
,
D.C.
,
and
Pell
,
S.K.
,
unpublished
data
)
.
Within
Spondioideae
,
the
Panamanian
fossil
taxon
closely
resembles
the
extant
genus
Dracontomelon
,
(
Plate
V
,
19
–
21
)
in
the
presence
of
endocarps
with
five
,
single
seeded
locules
,
and
radially
arranged
,
convex-dorsal-apical
germination
valves
without
median
longitudinal
slits
,
five
lacunae
,
ten
peripheral
equatorial
apertures
that
are
connected
to
the
lacunae
,
and
the
organization
of
tissues
making
up
the
endocarp
.
The
combination
of
these
characters
is
unique
to
Dracontomelon
.
The
connection
between
the
lacunae
and
the
external
apertures
of
the
endocarp
,
together
with
plug-like
opercula
without
median
longitudinal
slits
,
distinguish
this
fossil
from
the
otherwise
similar
extinct
genus
Pentoperculum
(
Manchester
,
1994
)
,
and
are
the
most
significant
characters
for
the
placement
of
the
Panamanian
fossil
within
the
modern
genus
.
Two
fossil
species
based
on
endocarps
from
the
Eocene
London
Clay
flora
were
placed
within
Dracontomelon
(
Reid
and
Chandler
,
1933
)
,
however
,
both
species
have
bipartite
valves
presumed
to
have
opened
like
shutters
and
the
lacunae
do
not
appear
connected
to
the
exterior
apertures
.
One
of
the
London
Clay
fossil
species
(
D
.
minimum
Reid
and
Chandler
)
was
transferred
to
the
genus
Pentoperculum
also
known
from
the
Nut
Beds
flora
of
the
Clarno
Formation
(
Manchester
,
1994
)
.
Although
the
second
species
(
D
.
subglobosum
Reid
and
Chandler
)
was
not
formally
transferred
to
Pentoperculum
,
new
transverse
sections
of
one
of
the
paratypes
(
Manchester
,
personal
observation
)
support
its
placement
within
Pentoperculum
as
well
.
No
other
fossil
shows
the
combination
of
characters
present
in
Dracontomelon
macdonaldii
,
and
this
is
the
first
recognition
of
this
extant
Old
World
genus
in
the
American
fossil
record
.
Modern
Dracontomelon
consists
of
eight
species
of
trees
,
found
almost
entirely
in
lowland
rainforests
of
India
to
Myanmar
,
tropical
China
,
Malaysia
,
and
Fiji

Systematic
affinity
—
Cruxifructus
shows
strong
similarity
with
the
fruits
observed
in
two
closely
related
families
of
the
Lamiales
,
i.e.
,
Verbenaceae
and
Lamiaceae
.
In
these
families
there
are
two
connate
carpels
which
develop
false
septa
giving
the
appearance
of
four
independent
locules
,
usually
forming
a
schizocarp
that
splits
into
four
nutlets
(
Judd
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
Several
features
suggest
to
us
an
affinity
of
Cruxifructus
eocenicus
with
Verbenaceae
or
Lamiaceae
:
the
constant
appearance
of
four
locules
,
cross-shaped
septa
;
two
of
the
septa

All

based
on
detailed
comparison
with
several
genera
(

,
Tectona
,
Vitex
)
,
we
consider
it
likely
that
the
Panamanian
fossil
represents
an
extinct
genus
within
Verbenaceae
or
Lamiaceae
.
Lamiaceae

an

Systematic
affinity
—
Loculifructus
tonosiense
resembles
,
at
least
superficially
,
the
Eocene
fossil
fruit
genera
Melicarya
(
Reid
and
Chandler
,
1933
)
from
the
London
Clay
flora
and
Tiffneycarpa
(
Manchester
,
1994
)
from
the
Nut
Beds
flora
of
the
Clarno
Formation
,
Oregon
.
According
to
recent
observations
these
two
fossil
genera
appear
to
be
synonyms
(
Manchester
,
S.R
,
personal
examination
)
.
The
Panamanian
fossil
is
similar
to
Melicarya
and
Tiffneycarpa
in
general
morphology
,
it
is
within
the
range
of
the
number
of
carpels
and
locules
,
presents
the
same
locule
and
seed
shape
as
seen
in
transverse
section
,
and
probably
similar
dehiscence
type
,
characterized
by
a
longitudinal
plane
of
weakness
extending
from
each
locule
to
the
fruit
periphery
.
However
,
several
differences
support
the
placement
of
this
fossil
within
a
separate
genus
.
In
L
.
tonosiense
the
septa
are
thicker
and
do
not
continue
to
the
axis
of
the
fruit
as
seen
in
the
endocarps
of
the
London
Clay
and
Nut
Bed
floras
;
the
new
fossil
also
lacks
the
ten
vascular
bundles
and
the
expanded
apical
cavity
of
the
central
axis
.
Despite
these
differences
it
is
likely
that
L
.
tonosiense
could
have
been
related
to
the
northern
hemisphere
taxa
during
the
Eocene
.
Melicarya
was
classified
as
an
extinct
genus
of
the
family
Meliaceae
(
Reid
and
Chandler
,
1933
)
and
for
Tiffneycarpa
no
affinity
was
suggested
.
We
have
not
observed
yet
any
fruit
within
Meliaceae
that
supports
the
placement
of
Loculifructus
within
this
family
.
The
fruit
morphology
of
Loculifructus
excludes
placement
among
extant
monocots
and
its
syncarpy
suggests
that
it
belongs
to
Eudicots
.
Within
this
large
angiosperm
clade
,
Ericaceae
(
e.g.
modern
genera
such
as
Planocarpa
,
Leptecophylla
,
and
Styphelia
)
has
capsules
that
resemble
the
fossil
taxon
in
several
characters
:
size
and
general
morphology
,
carpel
number
,
seed
shape
in
transverse
section
,
and
locules
accompanied
by
a
longitudinal
splitting
plane
that
runs
from
the
most
exmedial
point
of
the
locule
to
the
exocarp
wall
,
this
character
appears
related
to
the
dehiscence
of
the
fruit
.
However
,
we
have
not
observed
in
extant
Ericaceae
the
thick
septa
and
seed
anatomy
as
seen
in
Loculifructus
.
Therefore
we
refrain
from
assigning
these
fossils
to
this
family
until
a
more
detailed
survey
of
extant
representatives
of
this
and
other
ericalean
families
is
conducted
.

Discussion
The
Tonosí
fruit
and
seed
flora
constitute
the
only
macrofossil
paleobotanical
record
so
far
known
for
the
Eocene
in
southern
Central
America
.
This
flora
,
together
with
the
pollen
and
spore
flora
of
lignite
from
the
Gatuncillo
Formation
from
Central
Panama
(
Graham
,
1985
and
Graham
,
1994
)
,
coincides
with
the
Eocene
uplift
of
terranes
above
sea
level
from
the
volcanic
arc
that
gave
origin
to
southern
Central
America
(
Wegner
et
al.
,
2011
,
Buchs
et
al.
,
2011
and
Montes
et
al.
,
2012
;
Fig.
1
)
.
The
sedimentology
of
the
Tonosí
locality
,
the
co-occurring
invertebrate
fauna
,
and
the
stratigraphic
sequence
in
Azuero
Peninsula
,
suggest
that
the
fruits
and
seeds
were
deposited
in
a
shallow
coastal
setting
supplied
with
sandy
and
muddy
terrestrial
sediments
.
Therefore
,
it
is
probable
that
the
fossil
disseminules
grew
in
nearby
forests
.
Two
fossil
taxa
,
Dracontomelon
and
Lacunofructus
(
Plate
IV
and
Plate
V
)
,
seem
to
exhibit
a
full
size
range
,
from
very
small
to
large
specimens
,
indicating
that
their
provenance
may
have
been
local
.
Given
the
sedimentary
conditions
where
the
fossils
are
found
,
it
is
also
likely
that
some
of
the
disseminules
were
transported
by
sea
currents
to
the
final
site
of
deposition
.
The
relatively
low
plant
diversity
observed
from
Tonosí
(
eight
taxa
among
~
70
specimens
)
could
be
the
product
of
taphonomic
filtering
,
from
the
sedimentary
environment
and
perhaps
to
the
ecological
stress
and/or
reduced
area
caused
by
the
complex
geological
history
of
the
volcanic
arc
in
the
region
(
Coates
et
al.
,
2004
,
Iturralde-Vinent
,
2006
,
Buchs
et
al.
,
2011
and
Montes
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
We
interpret
the
Tonosí
macroflora
as
a
record
of
the
vegetation
that
colonized
(
maybe
with
some
mixture
of
ocean-carried
debris
)
the
new
landscape
produced
by
the
onset
of
the
emergence
of
the
volcanic
arc
in
southern
Central
America
,
that
started
during
the
middle
to
late
Eocene
.
The
tectonic
event
that
led
to
the
uplift
of
the
volcanic
arc
in
Tonosí
area
seems
to
be
the
same
that
uplifted
the
Gatuncillo
area
(
190
km
northeast
of
Tonosí
)
(
Montes
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
From
the
late
Eocene
Gatuncillo
Formation
,
Graham
,
1985
and
Graham
,
1994
reported
87
palynomorphs
,
with
their
floristic
affinities
including
Selaginellaceae
,
Bromeliaceae
,
Anacardiaceae
,
Bignoniaceae
,
Fabaceae
,
Malvaceae
,
Malpighiaceae
,
Moraceae
,
Myrtaceae
,
Polygonaceae
,
Rubiaceae
,
and
Sapotaceae
.
Graham
,
1985
and
Graham
,
1994
reconstructed
this
Eocene
flora
as
a
tropical
rainforest
fringed
by
mangrove
vegetation
.
The
new
fossils
from
Tonosí
augment
the
list
of
typical
tropical
families
found
in
the
Eocene
rainforests
in
Central
America
,
e.g.
Arecaceae
,
Humiriaceae
,
and
Vitaceae
.
The
identification
of
Dracontomelon
(
Anacardiaceae
)
and
cf.
Leea
(
Vitaceae
)
(
Plate
II
and
Plate
V
)
in
the
Tonosí
locality
provides
interesting
paleobiogeographic
implications
.
These
two
genera
are
currently
restricted
only
to
the
Old
World
tropical
rainforests
(
Dracontomelon
in
Australasia
;
Leea
in
southern
Asia
and
Malaysia
,
Africa
,
and
Madagascar
)
.
The
Tonosí
fossils
are
the
oldest
record
for
these
two
genera
so
far
,
so
it
is
possible
that
they
reached
the
growing
terranes
of
Central
America
from
nearby
rainforests
of
South
or
North
America
,
although
no
other
confirmed
older
fossils
of
Dracontomelon
and
Leea
have
been
reported
elsewhere
.
It
is
still
unknown
when
Dracontomelon
and
Leea
became
extinct
in
the
Neotropics
.
However
,
their
absence
from
a
new
collected
assemblage
of
abundant
permineralized
fruits
and
seeds
,
from
sedimentological
similar
beds
of
the
lower
to
middle
Miocene
Cucaracha
Formation
,
along
the
Panama
Canal
(
Herrera
et
al.
,
2010
;
Herrera
and
Manchester
personal
observation
)
,
may
suggest
local
extinction
in
Central
America
sometime
prior
to
~
20
–
15
million
years
ago
.
Fossil
endocarps
of
Menispermaceae
recently
found
in
the
Paleocene
Cerrejón
and
Bogota
formations
in
Colombia
(
Herrera
et
al.
,
2011
)
also
show
affinity
with
extant
African
and
Australasian
genera
,
suggesting
that
long-distance
dispersal
events
between
New
and
Old
World
forests
were
common
in
the
Paleogene
.
Saxuva
(
Plate
III
)
,
the
new
extinct
genus
belonging
to
the
tetramerous
clade
of
the
grape
family
(
Vitaceae
)
,
also
has
biogeographic
significance
.
This
fossil
and
the
abovementioned
specimen
of
cf.
Leea
constitute
the
earliest
records
of
Vitaceae
in
the
Neotropics
.
The
fossil
leaf
taxon
,
Cissites
patagonicus
Berry
,
from
the
Paleocene
of
Argentina
was
assigned
to
Vitaceae
(
Berry
,
1937
)
,
however
,
examination
of
the
published
photos
leads
us
to
question
the
familial
assignment
.
So
far
,
the
Vitaceae
seem
to
be
absent
from
well-collected
Paleocene
strata
of
Colombia
,
but
it
is
possible
that
the
diagnostic
,
but
small
seeds
have
been
overlooked
by
investigators
concentrating
on
leaf
remains
.
Vitaceae
seem
to
be
absent
up
to
now
from
Upper
Cretaceous
and
Paleocene
collections
in
South
America
.
Accordingly
,
it
is
possible
that
Vitaceae
may
have
entered
the
Neotropical
region
via
the
earliest
Central
American
terranes
.
Later
,
during
the
early
Oligocene
Vitaceae
flourished
in
extinct
Pacific
rainforests
of
Peru
,
this
is
supported
by
four
taxa
,
based
on
well-preserved
seeds
from
the
Belén
flora
(
Berry
,
1927
and
Chen
and
Manchester
,
2007
,
Herrera
and
Manchester
,
personal
observation
)
.
Dracontomelon
and
the
subfamily
Spondioideae
,
to
which
,
it
belongs
have
been
considered
to
be
basal
within
the
Anacardiaceae
(
Pell
,
2004
)
.
Nevertheless
,
recent
studies
suggest
that
the
Spondioideae
may
be
polyphyletic
(
Pell
et
al.
,
2011
)
.
The
new
species
from
Panama
adds
to
the
rich
Eocene
record
of
fruits
of
Anacardiaceae
;
Choerospondias
,
Lannea
,
and
Pentoperculum
from
the
London
Clay
flora
(
Reid
and
Chandler
,
1933
and
Collinson
and
Cleal
,
2001
)
,
Anacardium
from
Messel
,
Germany
(
Manchester
et
al.
,
2007
)
,
and
Rhus
from
the
Eocene
of
Oregon
(
Manchester
,
1994
)
.
The
anacardiaceous
fruit
fossil
species
confirmed
so
far
expand
vastly
the
range
of
distribution
observed
today
for
these
genera
.
The
new
genus
Lacunofructus
cuatrecasana
(
Plate
IV
)
supports
a
previous
study
of
the
dominantly
Neotropical
Humiriaceae
that
suggested
that
this
family
likely
originated
in
tropical
America
(
Herrera
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
This
is
based
on
confirmed
and
abundant
fossil
endocarps
and
pollen
from
South
and
Central
America
,
together
with
discreditation
of
former
reports
from
Europe
.
L.
cuatrecasana
is
the
oldest
record
for
the
family
,
although
molecular
divergence
time
estimates
suggest
a
pre-Cenozoic
origin
(
Davis
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
Although
no

or

from

was

within

recognized
from

,
two
taxa
(
i.e.
Dracontomelon
and
Loculifructus
;
Plate

and
Plate

)
seem
to
show
close
affinity
with
those
Laurasian
floras

we
are

Conclusions
The
new
Eocene
fossil
fruits
from
Panama
are
a
record
of
the
early
vegetation
in
the
emergent
Eocene
volcanic
arc
of
southern
Central
America
.
Whether
these
fossil
taxa
reached
the
terranes
from
nearby
forests
from
South
or
North
America
,
as
a
result
of
transoceanic
long-distance
dispersal
,
or
as
a
combination
of
both
sources
is
still
unknown
.
It
could
be
proposed
that
the
plant
taxa
from
Tonosí
have
evolved
in
situ
with
previous
arrival
of
the
stem
lineages
,
but
this
hypothesis
would
require
that
the
taxa
that
gave
origin
to
the
Panamanian
fossils
reached
this
region
before
the
late
Eocene
.
However
,
the
Tonosí
sequences
,
as
well
as
Gatuncillo
lignite
,
are
the
oldest
evidence
of
subaerial
deposition
in
southern
Central
America
(
Montes
et
al.
,
2012
)
,
so
favoring
a
late
Eocene
colonizing
scenario
.
The
affinities
of
the
fossil
disseminules
from
the
Tonosí
locality
also
suggest
families
and
genera
typical
of
extant
tropical
rainforests
,
in
accordance
with
a
previous
pollen
record
from
the
Eocene
Gatuncillo
Formation
(
Graham
,
1985
)
.
Some
of
the
new
families/orders
from
the
Tonosí
locality
include
Arecaceae
,
Vitaceae
,
Humiriaceae
,
Anacardiaceae
,
and
Lamiales
.
Biogeographically
,
two
of
the
Tonosí
fossil
taxa
,
Dracontomelon
and
Leea
,
are
interesting
because
they
occur
today
only
in
lowland
rainforests
of
the
Old
World
.
The
Tonosí
fossils
offer
a
unique
opportunity
to
understand
the
composition
of
the
earliest
plant
communities
in
southern
Central
America
,
a
period
when
no
land
connection
with
South
(
and
probably
North
)
America
existed
yet
.
