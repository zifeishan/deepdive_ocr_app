Structurally preserved ascomycetous fungi from the Maastrichtian type area (NE Belgium) Abstract Various structurally preserved ascomycetous fungus structures found in and on leaves of the Late Maastrichtian conifer Brachyphyllum patens (Cheirolepidiaceae?) are described: (1) stomatal hypostromata with attached hyphae and a probable fruit body ( Pteropus brachyphylli , gen. et sp. nov., Venturiaceae); (2) nonstomatal epicuticular stromata, including a thyriothecium with septate spores (?Micropeltidaceae, ?Microthyriaceae); (3) nonstomatal subcuticular stromata (?Phacidiaceae, ?Rhytismataceae); and (4) unidentified epicuticular and endophytical hyphae. Pteropus brachyphylli is considered as a close relative of extant Phaeocryptopus (Venturiaceae), species of which infect leaves of conifers belonging to the Araucariaceae, Cupressaceae, Pinaceae and Podocarpaceae. Pteropus brachyphylli may have been closely associated with cheirolepidiaceous conifers, which became extinct near the end of the Cretaceous. To date, it is the only fossil representative of Phaeocryptopus -like fungi. Pteropus brachyphylli is believed to have occupied a niche comparable to that of its modern relatives, which are weak parasites or sometimes saprophytes. Its presence in the Late Maastrichtian sets a minimum age of c. 66.5 million years for the kind of host–fungus relationships as nowadays present between conifers and Phaeocryptopus species. Keywords Ascomycota ; Phaeocryptopus ; Cheirolepidiaceae ; stomata ; Maastrichtian 1. Introduction In the framework of the Palaeontological Association's project ‘Fossils of the Type Maastrichtian’ ( Donovan and Jagt, in preparation ), seven conifer species are listed so far ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ; Van der Ham et al., 2001 , Van der Ham et al., 2003 , Van der Ham et al., 2004 , Van der Ham and Van Konijnenburg-van Cittert, 2003 and Van der Ham and Van Konijnenburg-van Cittert, 2004 ). In a specimen of one of these conifers, Brachyphyllum patens (Miquel) Van der Ham et Van Konijnenburg-van Cittert (Cheirolepidiaceae? Plate I 1–3), numerous small dark dots were noticed on the leaves, which, using scanning electron microscopy, appeared to be fillings of stomatal pits ( Plate I 4–6). First, they were interpreted as wax plugs, as found in the Early Cretaceous Araucaria lanceolatus from Australia ( Cantrill, 1992 , fig. 5A, B). However, in thin sections, they appeared to be connected with fungus hyphae infecting the leaves ( Van der Ham et al., 2003 ). Further observations led to the conclusion that the dark dots are the hypostromata of an ascomycetous fungus, i.e., the bases of its fruit bodies. Besides these hypostromata, the thin sections revealed several other ascomycetous fungus structures, which are also described here. Fungi are scarce in the Santonian to Danian limestone deposits in the Maastrichtian type area. Debey and Von Ettingshausen (1859a) described four species found on angiosperm leaves: Aecidites stellatus , Himantites alopecurus , Hysterites dubius and Sphaerites solitarius , of which only A. stellatus (order Uredinales) was accepted by Tiffney and Barghoorn (1974) . All four species come from the rich Santonian deposits of the sandy/clayey Aken Formation of the Aachen area, NE Belgium/W Germany ( Göppert, 1842 , Debey, 1848 , Debey and Von Ettingshausen, 1859a , Debey and Von Ettingshausen, 1859b , Ubaghs, 1885 , Lange, 1890 , Stockmans, 1946 , Meijer, 2000 and Kunzmann et al., 2003 ). Kräusel (1922) and Kräusel and Jongmans (1923) described unnamed fungus remains from gymnospermous and angiospermous leaves resembling Microthyriaceae (Ascomycota) and dematiaceous anamorphic fungi from Santonian beds in borings near Swalmen and Over-Eys (Limburg, SE Netherlands), respectively (not listed by Tiffney and Barghoorn, 1974 ). Dijkstra (1949) described hollow vesicles with long bristles from the Santonian of the coal mine Maurits near Geleen (Limburg, SE Netherlands) as Geleenites fascinus (gen. et sp. nov.; incertae sedis). Jansonius et al. (1981) reexamined the material and identified it as a fungal fruit body related to modern Ascotricha (Ascomycota, Xylariaceae). Batten (1988) provided scanning electron micrographs of G. fascinus . So far, no fungi were recorded from the limestone deposits of the Campanian, Maastrichtian and Danian in the type area of the Maastrichtian. Further, the present find is the first in the area (Santonian–Danian) revealing anatomical details. 2. Material, locality and stratigraphy The fungi were observed in a number of silicified detached leaves of the conifer Brachyphyllum patens (Miquel) Van der Ham et Van Konijnenburg-van Cittert embedded in dark grey, fine-grained flint material belonging to specimen NHMM RD 265 in the collection of the second author in the Natuurhistorisch Museum Maastricht, The Netherlands ( Van der Ham et al., 2003 ). This specimen originates from the Valkenburg Member (Maastricht Formation, Belemnitella junior Zone, Late Maastrichtian; Jagt, 1999 ; Fig. 2 ) in the Romontbos quarry near Eben-Emael (NE Belgium; Fig. 1 ). 3. Methods The flint material was prepared with hammer and chisel in order to uncover leaf surfaces and cross-sections, and subsequently thin sectioned. Four thin cross-sections of three leaves were made: (1 and 4) of leaf A (± transverse); (2) of leaf B (± longitudinal); and (3) of leaf C (oblique). Light micrographs were taken with a Leitz Dialux 20 on diapositive films and with a digital camera on an Olympus BH-2, using the programme analySIS (Soft Imaging Systems). Scanning electron micrographs were produced with a Jeol JSM-5300, using a Bal-Tec SCD 005 sputter coater and the programme SemAfore (Jeol). 4. Results The fungal structures described below include stromata (stroma: “a mass or matrix of vegetative hyphae, with or without tissue of the host or substrate, …, in or on which spores or fruit bodies bearing spores are produced”; Kirk et al., 2001 ), parts of stromata and hyphae. Four kinds of structures are distinguished here: (1) stomatal hypostromata; (2) nonstomatal epicuticular stromata; (3) nonstomatal subcuticular stromata (one including spores); and (4) epicuticular and endophytical hyphae. 4.1. Stomatal hypostromata The hypostromata ( n = c. 112 in thin sections 1–4; Plate II and Plate III ) are considered to represent the endophytical parts of stromata of which the epicuticular, spore producing fruit bodies (ascomata and/or conidiomata) are missing (however, see below), possibly due to abrasion during transport. They are invariably found in the stomata of the host leaves ( Plate I and Plate II ), adaxially as well as abaxially (only few uninfected stomata occur), and are considered to belong to a single species. Each hypostroma consists of a dense mass of vegetative hyphal elements filling the stomatal pit (in cuticle), the furrow between the guard cells, the guard cells themselves and possibly sometimes also the subsidiary and encircling cells (in epidermis), and the top of the respiratory chamber (in hypodermis) ( Plate II and Plate III 1–4). The elements in the top of the respiratory chamber are connected with hyphae that branch throughout the chamber and probably further into the leaf tissues ( Plate II and Plate III ). In the stomatal pit, the mass of hyphal elements conforms to the obconical shape and the size of the pit: c. 60 μm in diameter at the surface of the c. 30 μm thick cuticle. In the pit, the elements are ± isodiametrical to elongate and more elongate towards and in the furrow, while in the guard cells and the respiratory chambers they are ± isodiametrical ( Plate II 2). Because of the predominantly longitudinal arrangement of the furrows and guard cells of the stomata, the thin sections show various views of the hypostromata. In the ± transverse thin sections 1 and 4 ( Plate III 1, 2), the hyphal fillings of the two guard cells of a stoma manifest themselves mostly as wing-like appendages of the hypostroma. The heavily cutinised free surfaces of the guard cells provide clear separations between the ‘wings’ and the hyphal mass between and under the guard cells, and the hypostroma appears constricted in the furrow. In the ± longitudinal thin section 2 ( Plate III 3, 4), the guard cells of a stoma manifest themselves mostly as 55–90 μm long, slightly curved (concave side towards the cuticle) kidney- to banana-shaped hyphal masses ( Plate III 3–6), while the hypostroma appears less constricted in the furrow. Often, the subsidiary and encircling cells of the dicyclic stomata ( Plate I 7) can be observed as ‘shells’ around the wing-like hypostroma parts in the guard cells ( Plate III 4, 5). Depending on the position and orientation of a stoma in a thin section, part of a hypostroma may be missing in the section, e.g., one of the ‘wings,’ the narrow lower part of the stomatal pit filling or even the whole pit filling ( Plate III 5, 6). The hyphae connected to the elements in the upper parts of the respiratory chambers are c. 2 μm wide and show clear septa. A single structure (thin section 3, adaxial; Plate IV ) probably representing the epicuticular fruit body (ascoma or conidioma) belonging to the kind of hypostromata described above was found. It is a slice (largest diameter c. 190 μm) of a spheroidal structure ( Plate IV 1) consisting of a single layer of c. 10 μm large cells with sinuous walls ( Plate IV 2), embedded in a layer of 3 μm thick hyphae and probably based in a stomatal pit. Obvious connections to the embedding hyphae cannot be detected. The pit contains a small part of the presumed hypostroma ( Plate IV 3; unfortunately, rest of stoma and stroma not in section), which resembles the corresponding part of the above hypostromata. 4.2. Nonstomatal epicuticular stromata Seven nonstomatal epicuticular stromata and many fragments of such structures were observed (thin sections 1–4; Plate V ). These stromata are thyriothecium-like structures (ascomata and/or conidiomata) of 20–70 μm high and 180–400 μm in diameter. Their peridia are one-layered and consist of cells with very dark contents. The largest specimen (70 × 400 μm; thin section 3; Plate V 3) shows contents with a converging pattern directed towards an ostiole of c. 10 μm diameter and contains a number of septate, two-celled spores (didymospores) of c. 10 × 3.5 μm without traces of asci ( Plate V 4–6). The others are empty or contain indistinct, thin-walled structures, and do not have a clear ostiole, at least not in the sections studied. 4.3. Nonstomatal subcuticular stromata Eight nonstomatal subcuticular stromata and a few fragments of such structures were found, one abaxially (thin section 4), the others adaxially (thin sections 2 and 4; Plate VI 1–4). These stromata are apothecium-like structures (ascomata and/or conidiomata) of 150–400 μm in diameter that arise below the cuticle from epidermal cells, grow through or upset the cuticle, and, except for a subparallel pattern of thin-walled structures (asci and/or paraphyses? Plate VI 4), do not show any remarkable internal details. 4.4. Epicuticular and endophytical hyphae Epicuticular, c. 3-μm-thick hyphae cover the cuticula (thin sections 1–4; Plate III and Plate IV ), often as a thick layer, and seem to connect all stomatal and nonstomatal stromata. However, it is impossible to ascertain unambiguous connections. Likewise, the 1- to 3-μm-thick hyphae infecting nearly all internal parts of the leaves ( Plate VI 5, 6), except for those in the respiratory chambers (see above), cannot be ascribed to either the stomatal or one of the nonstomatal structures. 4.5. Inclusions Throughout all four thin sections, cells of most leaf tissues show (semi)globular parietal, often brown inclusions or cavities of various sizes ( Plate III and Plate VI ); only the thick-walled transfusion cells lack both hyphae and inclusions/cavities. The inclusions/cavities are assumed to reflect deposition of material from the cell contents (resin?), possibly as a response to the fungal infection (see also Stubblefield et al., 1985 , Taylor, 1990 and Taylor and Taylor, 1993 ). 5. Affinities and comparisons On account of their overall morphology, the stromatal structures described above are all considered to belong to the Ascomycetes (ascomycetous Ascomycota). 5.1. Stomatal hypostromata The stomatal hypostromata are very much like those described by, e.g., Petrak (1938) , Müller and Von Arx (1962 , fig. 174), Butin (1970 , figs. 1 and 2), Sutton (1980 , fig. 219) and Butin (1995 , figs. 18, 20) sub Phaeocryptopus Naumov (teleomorph) and its anamorphic form Rhizosphaera L. (family Venturiaceae, order Pleosporales; Kirk et al., 2001 ). Nowadays, the species of both genera are classified in Phaeocryptopus . The genera Parodiopsis (= Perisporiopsis ), Stomatogene and the Dimerium group, mentioned by Petrak (1938) as the closest relatives, are morphologically different (e.g., no hyphal elements in guard cells) and do not grow on conifers. Phaeocryptopus has exclusively stomatal stromata that grow only on leaves of conifers: Araucariaceae ( Araucaria ), Cupressaceae ( Fitzroya ), Pinaceae ( Abies , Picea , Pinus Pseudotsuga , Tsuga ) and Podocarpaceae ( Podocarpus , Saxegothaea ). Conifer leaves infected by Phaeocryptopus characteristically show small black epicuticular spheroidal fruit bodies (representing ascomata in teleomorphs and conidiomata in anamorphs) according to the arrangement of the stomata. Phaeocryptopus araucariae , Phaeocryptopus australis ( Butin, 1970 , Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ) and P. Phaeocryptopus kalkhoffii ( Sutton, 1980 , fig. 219c) show hyphal elements in the guard cells. In P. araucariae , they completely fill up the guard cells, which resembles the condition in the fossil material very much. Because of the close resemblance, the fossil species described above is considered closely related to the extant species of Phaeocryptopus . Because only hypostromata are represented, while the single probable fruit body is empty (no asci, ascospores or conidia present), it is impossible to assign the fossil species to the genus Phaeocryptopus Naumov, the diagnosis of which (emended by Petrak, 1938 ) contains a considerable portion of reproductive characters. Therefore, the fossil species is placed in the morphotaxon Pteropus , gen. nov. (family Venturiaceae, order Pleosporales). As far as known ( Tiffney and Barghoorn, 1974 and Taylor, 1994 ), fossils resembling Phaeocryptopus have not been described earlier. The Pleosporites found by Suzuki (1910) in leaves of the Late Cretaceous Cryptomeriopsis mesozoica (Taxodiaceae) has subcuticular perithecia. 5.2. Nonstomatal epicuticular stromata The nonstomatal epicuticular stromata are much like those of representatives of the Micropeltidaceae (Dothideomycetidae inc. sed.; Kirk et al., 2001 ) and Microthyriaceae (order Microthyriales; Kirk et al., 2001 ), which are all didymosporous. Choosing between these families following the key of Müller and Von Arx (1962) is not possible, because the cross-sections of the stromata do not allow determining whether the arrangement of hyphal elements in the peridium is radial or not. No attempt towards a generic assignment has been made. Possibly, the stromata belong to different taxa. Fossils of the Micropeltidaceae and Microthyriaceae are well-known from the Cretaceous onwards ( Tiffney and Barghoorn, 1974 , Elsik, 1978 and Taylor, 1994 ). Alvin and Muir (1970) described the micropeltidaceous Stomiopeltites cretacea from leaves of an Early Cretaceous Frenelopsis -like Cheirolepidiaceae, of which the stromata occur mostly over stomata. Pons and Boureau (1977) found the same species on a Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) Frenelopsis . Further comparison with S. cretacea is not possible, because our material consist only of cross-sections. Pons and Boureau (1977) described also the microthyriaceous Mariusia andegavensis found on the same Frenelopsis material. This species differs from our sporulating specimen by having four-celled instead of two-celled spores. Kräusel (1922) and Kräusel and Jongmans (1923) found very dark, circular disc-like, 50–60 μm large fruit bodies of Microthyriaceae-like fungi and dematiaceous anamorphic fungi on conifer and angiosperm leaves from the Santonian of the Maastrichtian type area (SE Netherlands), but unfortunately, due to the lack of further details, no further comparison is possible. 5.3. Nonstomatal subcuticular stromata The nonstomatal subcuticular stromata do not show diagnostic characters that refer to a family or order of Ascomycetes. They show some resemblance to families like the Phacidiaceae (order Helotiales) and Rhytismataceae (order Rhytismatales) ( Müller and Von Arx, 1962 and Kirk et al., 2001 ). It is very possible that they belong to different taxa. 6. Systematics Phylum : Ascomycota (sac fungi). Stomatal hypostromata ( Plate II and Plate III ) Family : Venturiaceae (order Pleosporales).

Discussion At least three different ascomycetous fungi occur in and on the leaves of Brachyphyllum patens studied: (1) stomatal hypostromata, described here as Pteropus brachyphylli , gen. et sp. nov. (Venturiaceae), (2) nonstomatal epicuticular stromata (?Micropeltidaceae, ?Microthyriaceae), and (3) nonstomatal subcuticular stromata (?Phacidiaceae, ?Rhytismataceae). Pteropus brachyphylli is considered as a close relative of the extant species of Phaeocryptopus (Venturiaceae). Pteropus brachyphylli is the only fossil known to date matching such fungi, and it is believed to have occupied a niche comparable to that of its modern relatives. The teleomorphic form of Phaeocryptopus (7 species known: Müller and Von Arx, 1962 , Butin, 1970 and Kirk, 2004 ) is found on living, browning and dead leaves of conifers belonging to the Araucariaceae ( Araucaria ; S America), Cupressaceae ( Fitzroya ; S America), Pinaceae ( Abies , Picea , Pinus Pseudotsuga , Tsuga ; N America, Asia, Europe) and Podocarpaceae ( Podocarpus , Saxegothaea ; S America, Asia). Phaeocryptopus species are usually denoted as weak parasites (e.g., Petrak, 1938 , p. 17). P. gaeumannii is the Swiss Needle Cast pathogen, which may cause considerable damage in stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii in N America and Europe (e.g., Manter et al., 2003 ). Infection occurs in spring and summer through the stomata of the host. The mycelium ramifies throughout the leaf tissues from the summer through the winter. From the winter onwards, ascomata emerge from the stomata. Ascospores are produced in spring, which completes the cycle. Additional ascomata appear in the following years, and, depending on the degree of infection, affected leaves are shed 1 to several years earlier than unaffected leaves ( Butin, 1995 ). Humid conditions further the process. The anamorphic form of Phaeocryptopus (6 species known, formerly classified in Rhizosphaera : Sutton, 1980 and Kirk, 2004 ) is reported so far only from Pinaceae ( Abies , Picea , Pinus , Pseudotsuga , Tsuga ; throughout the world). Phaeocryptopus kalkhoffii may cause significant damage in plantations of Picea abies ( Butin, 1995 ). Besides as a weak parasite, this species has also been characterised as predominantly saprophytic ( Butin, 1995 ), developing and producing conidia rapidly after the leaves have died. Müller and Hallaksela (2000) have demonstrated the presence of endophytic P. kalkhoffii in symptomless leaves of P. abies , which prompted characterising the species as a possible pioneer decomposer ( Müller et al., 2001 ). Like most Phaeocryptopus species, Pteropus brachyphylli is considered here as a weak parasite rather than a saprotrophic. Also the presumed deposition of resin would point in this direction (see also Lepage et al., 1994 ). The host leaves studied, of which nearly all stomata are occupied by the hypostromata of P. brachyphylli , were probably seriously hampered in their gas exchange. Probably, they were already brown(ing) on the tree, though, in view of the relatively good condition of the leaf tissues, not much decayed. Brown(ing), deciduous leafy twigs ( Harris, 1976 ) may have been taken by wind and/or water and blown/washed into the nearby shallow Late Maastrichtian sea ( Jagt, 1999 ). During transport, the epicuticular fruit bodies were especially vulnerable, which might explain the presence of only a single (probable) specimen. The embedment in a layer of epicuticular hyphae may have saved it from abrasion. Surely, the leaves were readily silicified after deposition in the chalky sediment, or protected otherwise from further decay. As Phaeocryptopus species grow on representatives of only a single family or even genus, Pteropus brachyphylli may have been closely associated with cheirolepidiaceous conifers, which became extinct near the end of the Cretaceous, together with such diverse groups as the cycadeoids, dinosaurs and ammonites. Its presence at the base of the Maastricht Formation, just above the Lichtenberg Horizon, sets a minimum age of c. 66.5 million years ( Van Adrichem Boogaert and Kouwe, 1993 ) for the kind of host–fungus relationships as nowadays present between conifers and Phaeocryptopus species.
