Wave

are
validated
directly
against

originating
from

The
normalized

for

is
shown
to
be
of
the
order
of
5%
for

An

is
also
performed
through

suggests
that
the

of

only
slightly

for

Introduction
Ocean

relevant
for
numerous
engineering
and

ln
thc

ocean.
Nevertheless,
the
proper
characterization
of
wave
height
inter-annual
variability
and
the
depiction
of
long-term
trends
require
long-term
times
series
while
wave
data
are
almost
inexistent
prior
to
1950.
Compared
to
local
measurements,
wave

offers
the
unique
aclvan-
of
a
global
coverage.
Thus,
found
a
general
global
upwarcl
trend
for
wind
speed
and
significant
wave
height
(H,)
over
the
periocl
1985-2008,
this
rate
being
larger
for
the
90th
and
99th
percentiles.
However,
the
24-year
covered
period
is
too
shot%
to
conclude
whether
this
upward
trencl
results
from
inter-annual
or
inter-

or
a
long

(

The

to

However,
20CR
ensemble-mean
wincl

are
expected
to
be
too
smooth
in
the
end
of
the
19th
centurial
(
which
is
a
major
limitation
to
force
a
dynamical
wave
hindcast.
In
par-
extreme
wincls

the
ensemble-mean

shown
to
be
low-biased
(
)
for

These
limitations
explain
why
this
study
was
restrictecl
to
the
analysis
of
yearly-mean
wave
heights
in
the
20th
century.
Finally,
3-hourly
time

of
wave
heights
were
archived
at
each
grid
nocle
ancl
long-term

were
computed
using
a

(
).
This
analysis
was
restrictecl
to
an
area
spanning
70'W-10'E
and
20'N-70'N
(
),
which
corresponds
to
the
area
where

observations
were
available
for
validation.

Vnlidation
of

ftelds
The
1
<
ey
issue
when
performing
a
wave
hinclcast
over
such
a
long
period
is
the
consistency
of
the
input
wincl
fields
along
the
time.
In
order
to
verify
the
quality
of
the
20CR
reanalysis
along
the
20th
century,
we
performed
a
point-by-point
comparison
with
sea-level
pressure
(SLP)
ancl
10
m
wind
speed
(Uto)
originating
from
VOS
data
reported
in
the
ICOADS
clatabase
(International
Comprehensive
Ocean-Atmosphere
Data
Set,
nual
ing
lates
responds
ticular,
).
This
data
was
not
assimilated
in
the
20CR
ancl
thereby
allows
for
an
inclependent
valida-
tion.
An
inter-comparison
between
SLP
and
U»
originating
from
the
pop-
ular
ERA40
(2.5'

2.5'/6

ancl
the
NCEP/NCAR
I
f875'
-"
1.875'/6
h)
reanalyzes
was
also
performecl
over
the
period
of
ERA40
(1958-2001).
For
each
year,
the
root
mean
square
of
the
difference
(hereafter
RMSD)
between
modeled
(20CR,
NCEP/NCAR
ancl
ERA40)
ancl
observed
(VOS)
SLP
and
Uto
was
performed
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
(70
W-O'W
and
20'N-70'N,
).
This
area
includes
a
large
density
of
observations,
ranging
from
a
few
tens
per
year
in
the
late
19th
centurial
to
several
hundreds
of
thousancls
for
the
last
6
decades.
This
comparison
reveals
firstly
a
goocl
agreement
between
observed
and
modeled
SLP
for
the
three
consiclered
atmospheric
reanalyzes,
with
a
root
mean
square
of
the
difference
(hereafter
RMSD)
of
the
order
of
2
HPa
from
1950
to
1990,
clecreasing
to
less
than
1.5
HPa
for
the
last
decacle
(;
A).
This
RMSD
increases
by
15%
for
the
20CR
reanalysis
for
the
first
half
of
the
20th
centurial,
although
two
orders
of
magnitude
less
observations
were
available
over
the
period
1900-
1920.
The
comparison
between
observed
and
modelecl
U»
for
the
three
selected
reanalyzes
shows
that
RMSD
is
of
the
orcler
of
3.5
m/s
for
the
period
1950-2010,
with
a
slight
decrease
over
the
last
decade
(;
B).
In
more
details,
ERA40
performs
slightly
better
than
20CR
and
NCEP,
although
the
comparison
shows
a
larger
negative
bias
of
the
order
of
2.0
m/s
(
).
Low-biased
wincls
in
ERA40
were
alreacly
reported
by
.
RMSD
and
NRMSD
for
U»
originating
from
20CR
only
show
a
10%
increase
for
the
period
1900-1950
compared
to
the
second
part
of
the
20th
centurial.
Finally,
the
comparison
between
20CR
reanalysis
ancl
VOS
clata
for
the
end
of
the
19th
century
reveals
that
both
SLP
and

and

A

can

at

Such

are
equivalent
to
an

over

which
corresponds

to
a

these

In

to

were
computed
between
the

These

reveal
a

and
large
positive
correlation
area
to
the
North-East
of
the

area,
with

A
significant

correla-
area
develops
between

with

coeffi-
reaching
0.5.
Finally,
a

area
cleveloped
to
the

of

with

To
distinguish
between
linear
trends
anti
inter-annual
variability
driven
by
the
NAO,
a
decomposition
in
Empirical
Orthogonal
Functions
(hereafter
EOFs;
)
of
yearly-mean
time
series
of
H,
was
performed
(
).
This
analysis
shows
that
the
1st
mode
ofdecom-
explains
74%
of
the
total
variance
of
yearly-mean
H,.
The
corre-
spatial
pattern
of
this
mode
(
A)
matches
closely
that
of
the
linear
trencls
of
B.
The
time-series
of
the
first
EOF
confirms
that
this
mode
corresponds
to
the
increase
in
H,
over
the
studied
period.
In
details,
the
increase
is
strong
during
a
first
period
from
1900
to
1960,
followed
by
a
second
period
from
1960
to
2008
where
the
increase
is
much
weal
<
er.
The
second
mode
of
decomposition
(
B)
explains
9%
of
the
total
variance
of
yearly-mean
Hs
and
the
associated
spatial
pattern
strongly
matches
that
of
the
correlation
map
between
yearly-
H,
anti
NAO
index
(
C).
This
agreement
is
confirmecl
by
the
associatecl
time-series,
which
is
well
correlatecl
with
the
yearly-mean
NAO
index
(R'
=
0.73,
B)
although
the
correlation
drops
between
1920
and
1930.
In
orcler
to
better
quantify
this
behavior,
Vearson
correlation
coefficients
were
computed
over
a

slicling

<

which
reveals
that
correlation

range
from

Discussion
and
conclusions
4.1.
Significance
of
the
trends
This
stucly
relies
on
a
new
numerical
wave
hindcast,
driven
by
wind
fielcls
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
starting
in
1900.
A
validation
of
wave
predictions
after
1955
was
undertal
<
en
based
on
VOS
and
revealed
that
errors
for
yearly-mean
H,
were
of
the
order
of
5%.
A
similar
direct
validation
prior
to
1950
was
not
possible
since,
according
to
the
author's
1
<
nowleclge,
wave
measurements
or
consistent
observation
is
insufficiently
available.
This
difficulty
ques-
the
reliability
of
our
results
for
the
periocl
1900-1955,
although
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
shown
to
be
homogeneous
for
the
North
Atlantic
over
the
20th
centut3r
(
).
Alternatively,
U»
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
comparecl
against
mea-
from
VOS,
which
revealed
that
errors
on
this
parameter
only
increasecl
by
10%
for
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century.
Nevertheless,
the
values
of
RMSD
for
U»
(arouncl
3.5
m.s
')
are
50%
larger
compared
to
the
values
usually
obtained
when
comparing
atmospheric
reanalysis
with
buoys
(e.g.
)
or
satellite
scatterometer
(e.g.
).
hl
aclclklon
to
the
plobably
weal
<
er
quality
of
VOS
data
compared
to
buoy
modern
measurements
or
scaterrometers,
this
difference
may
originate
from
the
interpolations
in
space
(the
three
atmospheric
reanaiyzes
have
spatial
resolutions
of
the
order
of
2')
anti
in
time
(3-
to
6-hourly
clata)
associatecl
with
our
RMSD
computation.
However,
the
comparison
between
VOS
and
20CR
aimed
at
investigating
how
much
U»
used
to
drive
our
wave
hindcast
deteriorates
over
the
studiecl
period
time
rather
than
provicling
an
absolute
validation
of
the
20CR
reanalysis.
It
is
accepted
that
the
dependence
of
H,
on
the
wind
spec
<
I
U
obeys
a
relationship
of
the
form
H,
=
Ul',
where
l'
>
is
a
coefficient
varying
between
1
for
short-fetch
limited
conditions
and
2
for
fully
developed
seas
(
).
In
this
stucly,
the
-10%
larger
errors
in
wind
spec
<
I
for
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
would
increase
the
NRMSE
in
H,
from
5%
for
the
period
1950-2008
to
6%
for
the
period
1900-1950.
Consequently,
the
20
to
40%
increases
in
H,
that
we
demonstrated
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
still
hold
robustly.

the

does
not

any

This
implies
that
the
large
increase
in
H,
(up
to
more
than
40%)
demonstrated
over
the
whole
North
Atlantic
Ocean
cannot
be
explained
by
the
NAO.
Our
interpretation
is
that
a
long-term
upward
trend
is
superimposed
on
the
partly
NAO-controlled
inter-annual
vari-
of

This

On

the
orcler

magnitude
of
the
upward

we
found
in
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
matches
the
finclings
of
other

Thus,
performed
a

numerical
hinclcast
around

on

and
found
trends
reaching
locally

for
the

In

used

buoy
measurements
and
found
a
0.015

increase
for
the
yearly-mean

over
the

This
value
is
corroboratecl
by
the
findings
of
who
found
a

in
this
region

over

These
upward
trends
in

directly
explain
the
upward
trencls
in

described
in
the
previous
section.
Unfortunately,
based
on
this

it
was
not
possible
to
determine
the
causes
for
the
upward
trends
in
wincl
speed
identified
over
the
North

On
the
one
hancl,
several
authors
found
that
global
warming
would
only
induce
minor
changes
in
the
frequency
anti
intensity
of
mid-latitucle
storms
(
).
On
the
other
hand,
other
studies
relying
on

I
c.g.
)
have
suggested
that
enhancecl
greenhouse
gas
forcing
would
yield
more
frequent
and
stronger
wind
storms.
Under
this
absence
of
consensus,
we
cannot
rule
out
the
possibility
that
the
increase
in
wind
speed
anti
wave
height
iclentifiecl
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
could
result,
at
least
partly,
from
the
increase

over
the
