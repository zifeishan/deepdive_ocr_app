Abstract
Two
coeval
speleothems
from
the
Black
Hills
are
used
to
investigate
δ
18
O
and
δ
13
C
variations
within
Reed
’s
Cave
and
reconstruct
climate
during
the
Wisconsin
glacial
period
from
82
000
to
24
000
years
ago
.
Variation
in
growth
rates
between
the
two
speleothems
reveals
a
strong
control
of
hydrology
and
surface
vegetation
on
isotopic
variability
and
response
of
δ
18
O
to
climate
.
High-resolution
δ
18
O
and
δ
13
C
data
show
that
local
environmental
conditions
can
produce
an
offset
of
δ
18
O
values
of
up
to
4
‰
in
coeval
speleothems
but
still
reveal
important
climate
events
.
The
transition
from
warmer
to
cooler
periods
results
in
an
increase
in
δ
18
O
of
calcite
(

)
in
sample
RC2
while
in

RC20
,
another

,
δ

is
offset
from
RC2
by
between
0
and
−
3.5

,
and
shows
much
higher

variation

interglacial/glacial

.
Spectral
analysis
of
the

records
for
both
speleothems
reveals
periodicity
at
1000
to

Introduction
Stable
isotope
variations
in
speleothem
calcite
are
precisely
datable
records
that
may
record
major
interglacial/glacial
transitions
and
lesser
climatic
events
(
Gascoyne
,
1992
,
Bar-Matthews
et
al.
,
1999
,
Frumkin
et
al.
,
1999
,
McDermott
et
al.
,
1999
and
Dorale
,
2000
.
The
validity
of
the
oxygen
isotope
signal
may
be
problematic
because
variables
controlling
isotopic
variation
in
the
local
cave
environment
can
mask
global
climate
signals
present
in
the
record
.
Recent
studies
of
coeval
samples
in
Israel
and
Missouri
correlate
well
with
ice
core
records
and
confirm
that
global
climate
signals
are
present
(
Bar-Matthews
et
al.
,
1999
,
Frumkin
et
al.
,
1999
and
Dorale
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
It
has
been
widely
presumed
that
discordant
oxygen
isotope
records
are
the
result
of
non-equilibrium
deposition
occurring
in
the
cave
.
This
assumes
that
the
relationship
of
isotopic
variation
to
climate
is
invariant
at
any
given
site
.
In
this
paper
two
samples
from
Reed
’s
Cave
in
the
Black
Hills
of
South
Dakota
with
discordant
but
coeval
growth
are
examined
to
show
that
within
a
cave
different
models
may
be
necessary
for
interpreting
isotopic
change
.
The
relationship
between
the
speleothem
isotope
record
and
climate
may
change
over
time
because
of
sensitivity
to
local
conditions
.
The
variability
of
isotopic
composition
at
different
drip
sites
within
a
cave
can
offer
different
,
but
still
useful
,
isotope
records
that
can
be
used
as
paleoclimate
proxies
.
Application
of
spectral
analysis
to
the
oxygen
isotope
time
series
has
revealed
millennial
scale
variability
in
both
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothems
described
below
.
Comparison
of
their
time
series
to
records
from
ocean
sediments
,
ice
cores
and
terrestrial
proxies
confirm
that
both
local-scale
and
global-scale
events
are
being
recorded
by
the
oxygen
isotope
variations
.

The
speleothem
samples
were

in
the
Black
Hills
of
South
Dakota
(
Fig.
1
)
.
The
Black
Hills
are
a
dissected
dome
exposing
a
sequence
of
sedimentary
rocks
with
significant
cave
development
in
the
Mississippian
limestones
(
Palmer
and
Palmer
,
1989
)
.
Nearby
Jewel
and
Wind
Caves
are
two
of
the
longest
cave
systems
in
the
world
but
contain
few
vadose
speleothems
formed
by
drip
waters
because
they
are
largely
covered
by
impermeable
clastic
strata
(
Bakalowicz
et
al.
,
1987
)
.
Reed
’s
Cave
is
at
shallow
depth
because
the
cover
and
upper
limestone
has
been
eroded
,
permitting
significant
amounts
of
speleothem
deposition
from
vadose
dripwaters
,
some
of
which
are
actively
depositing
today
.
Part
of
the
cave
underlies
a
quarry
that
has
been
active
for
the
past
20
years
.
The
blasting
activities
have
dislodged
hundreds
of
speleothems
,
enabling
us
to
remove
samples
without
destroying
any
intact
specimens
.
The
modern
vegetation
overlying
the
cave
system
is
a
mixed-grass
prairie
and
hardwood
forest
.
The
boundary
between
these
two
habitats
may
have
shifted
back
and
forth
during
the
late
Quaternary
(
Dorale
et
al.
,
1992
)
.
The
average
annual
surface
temperature
is
8
°
C
and
the
range
between
winter
and
summer
average
temperature
is
28
°
C.
Average
annual
precipitation
is
783
mm
with
476
mm
from
rain
and
307
mm
(
water
equivalent
)
from
snow
.
Seasonality
is
seen
in
more
active
infiltration
and
dripping
during
the
cooler
seasons
.
Theoretical
losses
in
moisture
during
summer
from
increased
evapotranspiration
are
reduced
locally
because
infiltrating
water
rapidly
reaches
karstic
voids
with
high
humidity
.

Methods
Speleothem
samples
RC2
and
RC20
were
collected
from
two
different
sections
in
Reed
’s
Cave
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Sample
RC2
was
collected
from
the
‘
New
Formations
Room
’
(
site
B
)
,
where
calcite
deposition
is
still
occurring
in
some
sections
.
Sample
RC20
(
site
A
)
was
collected
from
a
crawlway
to
the
northeast
that
appears
to
be
without
any
modern
drip
waters
.
RC20
and
the
upper
two-thirds
of
sample
RC2
have
the
standard
morphology
of
simple
stalagmites
,
which
accrete
most
new
growth
at
the
top
and
less
accumulation
from
film
flow
down
the
sides
(
Fig.
2
)
(
Ford
and
Williams
,
1989
,
pp.
335
–
336
)
.
The
lowest
(
i.e.
earliest
)
portion
of
RC2
grew
as
a
flowstone
cover
on
a
vertical
face
of
limestone
breccia
(
local
breakdown
in
the
cave
)
,
accreting
only
by
film
flow
until
it
had
sufficient
protrusion
to
support
the
stalagmite
growth
upwards
.
The
speleothems
were
cut
along
their
growth
axes
and
examined
for
post-depositional
alteration
,
which
was
absent
.
Sub-samples
for
dating
were
extracted
using
a
1.2-mm-diameter
carbide
dental
burr
or
a
diamond
wafering
blade
mounted
on
an
Isomet
low
speed
diamond
saw
.
A

was
added
to
the
sample
after
dissolution
with
dilute
HNO

(
Lundberg
,

)
.
The
U
and
Th
fractions
in
the
calcite
were
extracted
using
ferric

co-precipitation
and
anion
column
chemistry
in
a
clean
room
with
positive
pressure
(
Li
et
al.
,

)
.
Most
samples
were
analyzed
on
the
McMaster
VG
354
thermal
ionization
mass
spectrometer
(
TIMS
)
.
Uranium
was
loaded

Thorium
fractions
were
loaded
in

on
double

Some
samples
were
analyzed
on
a
Micromass
IsoProbe
multi-collector
inductive
coupled
plasma
mass
spectrometer
(
MC
–
ICP

)
at
the
GEOTOP
laboratory
of
the
University
of
Quebec
at
Montreal
,
run
in
static
multi-collection
mode
using
four
Faraday
collectors
.
Samples
dissolved
in
2
%
HNO
3
were
introduced
into
the
ICP
source
using
an
Aridus
microconcentric
nebulizer
.
For
data
reduction
we
used
a
spreadsheet
developed
by
B.
Ghaleb
.
Detailed
analytical
methods
for
both
TIMS
and
ICP
–
MS
analyses
are
presented
in
Serefiddin
(
2002
)
Calcite
samples
for
oxygen
and
carbon
isotope
analysis
were
drilled
out
using
0.8-mm
and
0.4-mm
cobalt
dental
drill
bits
.
The
derived
powders
,
approximately
100
micrograms
each
,
were
run
on
an
Autocarb
system
attached
to
an
Optima
mass
spectrometer
at
McMaster
.
Results
are
reported
in
‰
relative
to
Vienna
PeeDee
Belemnite
standard
.
The
precision
of
analyses
was
0.06
‰
for
both
isotope
ratios
.
Dripwaters
were
collected
as
spot
samples
,
with
some
of
the
slower
dripping
sites
left
overnight
.
Their
δ
18
O
values
were
determined
by
equilibration
of
water
with
CO
2
at
25
°
C
for
24
h
.
The
clean
CO
2
gas
was
run
on
the
Optima
mass
spectrometer
against
the
CO
2
tank
standard
.
Results
are
reported
relative
to
Vienna
Standard
Mean
Ocean
Water
and
with
an
error
of
0.2
‰
.
The
power
spectra
for
the
oxygen
isotope
records
were
obtained
using
the
program
SPECTRUM
(
Schulz
and
Statteger
,
1997
)
.
This
program
was
created
for
unevenly
spaced
time
series
like
speleothem
data
that
exhibit
distinctly
different
periods
of
growth
.
The
Lomb

Scargle
Fourier
transform
avoids
unnecessary
interpolation
that
may
occur
with
the
Blackman

Tukey
method

Relationships
between
climate
and
speleothem
records
Oxygen
isotope
variations
in
speleothem
calcite
can
be
used
as
a
paleoclimate
proxy
if
these
deposits
were
formed
in
oxygen
isotope
equilibrium
with
formation
waters
(
Schwarcz
,
1986
)
.
Equilibrium
conditions
occur
when
there
is
slow
deposition
of
calcite
from
the
drip
water
.
Rapid
degassing
of
CO
2
or
evaporation
of
drip
water
causes
kinetic
fractionation
effects
that
can
obscure
the
climate
signal
.
For
this
study
,
three
growth
layers
in
each
speleothem
were
used
for
the
equilibrium
test
,
i.e.
that
δ
18
O
ct
is
uniform
along
the
layer
(
Hendy
,
1971
)
.
No
covariance
in
oxygen
and
carbon
isotopes
along
the
growth
layers
was
found
and
there
was
almost
no
enrichment
of
18
O
towards
the
edges
of
the
growth
layers
,
indicating
that
there
was
equilibrium
deposition
.
One
growth
layer
in
speleothem
RC20
shows
some
enrichment
towards
the
edge
.
However
,
the
growth
layers
in
these
speleothems
are
very
difficult
to
differentiate
along
their
outer
portions
(
Fig.
2a
,
b
)
,
with
the
consequence
that
individual
values
for
δ
18
O
ct
may
be
averaging
thousands
of
years
of
growth
.
There
is
also
the
possibility
that
the
sample
locations
are
capturing
different
time
slices
.
We
have
also
attempted
to
determine
the
suitability
of
the
samples
by
comparing
them
with
other
proxy
records
including
other
speleothems
.
If
a
speleothem
grows
in
oxygen
isotope
equilibrium
with
drip
waters
,
then
variations
in
δ
18
O
of
the
calcite
(
Δ
δ
18
O
c
)
are
governed
by
the
equation
:
equation
(
1
)
which
relates
changes
in
δ
18
O
ct
to
the
temperature
dependent
changes
in
fractionation
between
calcite
and
water
(
α
ct
−
w
)
and
in
δ
18
O
of
precipitation
(
δ
18
O
p
)
and
to
changes
in
global
ice
volume
as
reflected
in
seawater
δ
18
O
sw
.
The
three
components
of
this
equation
are
defined
by
relationships
determined
from
experimental
and
empirical
studies
.
The
temperature
dependence
of
the
fractionation
is
:
equation
(
2
)
(
O’Neil
et
al.
,
1969
)
.
The
effect
of
temperature
on
the
isotopic
composition
of
meteoric
water
was
calculated
using
the
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
(
IAEA
)
data
set
from
many
global
precipitation
stations
.
The
global
average
for
the
temperature
effect
on
precipitation
is
:
equation
(
3
)
as
determined
by
Dansgaard
(
1964
)
and
Rozanski
et
al.
(
1993
)
.
The
relationship
varies
with
location
and
can
be
as
low
as
0.18
–
0.3
‰
/
°
C
for
some
inland
locations
.
From
our
measured
values
of
δ
18
O
in
dripwaters
from
different
seasons
and
winter
snow
values
and
the
corresponding
measured
temperatures
,
the
local
value
d
(
δ
18
O
p
)
/
dT
=
0.39
‰
/
°
C.
Secular
variation
in
this
relationship
in
the
past
allows
some
flexibility
in
these
values
when
applying
the
relationship
to
interpretation
of
paleoclimate
records
.
An
additional
complicating
factor
is
the
source
and
movement
of
storm
tracks
over
the
continent
at
different
times
in
the
past
.
Future
analyses
of
speleothem
fluid
inclusion
water
may
enable
determination
of
this
relationship
from
the
pre-Holocene
period
at
Reed
’s
Cave
(
Serefiddin
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
One
final
consideration
when
evaluating
the
δ
18
O
of
calcite
is
the
effect
of
the
isotopic
composition
of
seawater
on
global
meteoric
water
composition
.
We
can
estimate
that
Δ
(
δ
18
O
sw
)
=
1.2
‰
for
glacial
to
interglacial
transition
as
a
result
of
accumulation
of
lighter
oxygen
isotopes
in
ice
sheets
and
the
enrichment
of
heavy
isotopes
in
seawater
as
temperature
decreased
(
Lea
et
al.
,
2000
and
Fairbanks
,
1989
)
.
The
composition
of
precipitation
falling
on
the
continents
is
directly
affected
by
this
factor
because
seawater
is
the
principal
source
of
the
moisture
.
The
net
result
of
these
competing
effects
on
δ
18
O
ct
may
vary
significantly
between
caves
,
with
the
result
that
the
net
effect
of
decreasing
temperature
at
a
site
can
be
either
an
increase
or
decrease
in
δ
18
O
ct
.
The
general
sense
of
isotopic
change
in
response
to
climate
change
at
a
site
can
be
determined
by
comparison
of
ice-age
deposits
with
modern
speleothem
forming
at
the
same
site
.
As
we
shall
see
,
other
effects
can
also
lead
to
a
difference
in
the
temperature
dependence
of
δ
18
O
ct
at
different
locations
in
the
same
cave
.

Uranium-series
dating
and
growth
rates
Uranium-series
dates
are
presented
in
Table
1
.
Twelve
dates
in
stratigraphic
order
were
used
to
develop
the
age
model
for
sample
RC2
(
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
3
)
.
This
stalagmite
grew
from
86
000
to
24
000
years
ago
.
In
the
early
flowstone
stage
of
accumulation
from
0
to
20
mm
above
base
the
average
growth
rate
was
less
than
1
mm
per
thousand
years
.
Switching
to
the
stalagmite
mode
of
growth
at
50
000
years
ago
the
rate
increased
considerably
,
being
close
to
an
average
of
4.4
mm
per
thousand
years
until
∼
30
000
years
ago
.
The
rate
was
highest
in
the
last
section
of
growth
,
80
to
>
160
mm
from
the
base
,
attaining
a
value
of
about
12
mm
per
thousand
years
between
∼
30
000
and
24
000
years
ago
.
This
could
indicate
an
increase
in
catchment
area
for
the
dripwater
and/or
a
period
of
increased
precipitation
just
prior
to
the
last
glacial
maximum
at
20
000
years
ago
.
For
RC20
,
seven
ICP
dates
in
stratigraphic
order
establish
that
it
grew
from
63
000
to
50
000
years
ago
(
Fig.
2b
)
.
The
average
growth
rate
ranges
from
20
mm
per
thousand
years
to
a
maximum
of
70
mm
per
thousand
years
(

)
.
This
is
strong
evidence
that
different
drip
sites
within
a
cave
can
be
responding
to
different
drip
water
pathways
or
changes
in
catchment
area
,
which
,
as
will
be
shown
,
can
result
in
variable
isotope
records

.
Oxygen
isotopes
A
useful
tool
for
interpreting
oxygen
isotope
variations
is
to
determine
how
the
δ
18
O
ct
changes
with
temperature
.
This
can
be
done
in
two
ways
.
First
,
we
can
compare
δ
18
O
ct
formed
in
colder
periods
to
the
δ
18
O
ct
of
modern
(
interglacial
)
calcite
forming
in
the
cave
today
.
Second
,
we
can
observe
the
trend
in
δ
18
O
ct
with
time
during
a
transition
from
glacial
to
interglacial
climate
(
as
inferred
by
comparison
with
deep-sea
cores
or
other
global
records
)
.
From
these
comparisons
we
can
estimate
the
sign
of
d
(
δ
18
O
ct
)
/
dT
which
we
will
refer
to
as
gamma
(
γ
)
.
Dripwaters
in
the
cave
range
in
δ
18
O
from
−
10
to
−
15
‰
.
This
is
in
agreement
with
measured
values
of
approximately
−
10
to
−
14
‰
for
δ
18
O
of
modern
precipitation
in
this
region
(
IAEA
,
2001
)
.
Using
the
O’Neil
et
al.
(
1969
)
temperature
dependent
fractionation
equation
,
equation
(
4
)
equation
(
5
)
one
can
calculate
the
temperature
from
measured
δ
18
O
of
calcite
and
water
pairs
.
The
fractionation
between
the
calcite
–
water
pairs
is
temperature
dependent
,
thus
temperature
can
be
calculated
if
the
δ
18
O
values
are
known
.
The
average
δ
18
O
for
calcite
–
water
pairs
calculates
to
9.8
±
6
°
C
,
which
agrees
well
with
measured
modern
average
temperature
.
Two
samples
with
more
enriched
δ
18
O
of
the
water
cause
this
large
uncertainty
which
is
likely
due
to
airflow
introduced
into
the
cave
from
modern
quarrying
activities
.
Without
these
two
samples
the
uncertainty
,
calculated
from
variability
in
δ
18
O
of
water
,
is
reduced
to
2.4
°
C
.
We
can
assume
that
the
quarrying
activities
have
significantly
changed
the
airflow
and
possibly
the
groundwater
pathways
into
the
cave
,
so
the
modern
system
is
not
representing
similar
conditions
.
However
,
at
sites
where
equilibrium
conditions
do
exist
,
we
can
still
compare
calculated
temperatures
to
measured
modern
temperatures
.
Isotopic
measurements
of
four
actively
growing
speleothems
(
soda
straw
stalactites
)
have
a
modern
range
for
δ
18
O
ct
from
−
9
‰
to
−
13.6
‰
.
The
higher
δ
18
O
ct
values
are
likely
affected
by
evaporative
fractionation
because
humidity
in
the
cave
may
drop
below
90
%
.
The
more
depleted
values
at
∼
−
13
‰
are
more
representative
of
equilibrium
deposits
of
modern
δ
18
O
ct
.
The
reduced
humidity
does
not
appear
to
be
present
during
the
growth
period
of
the
paleodeposits
as
shown
by
results
from
equilibrium
tests
on
the
growth
layers
.
Speleothem
RC2
was
deposited
during
glacial
Marine
Isotopic
Stage
(
MIS
)
5a
,
4
,
3
and
the
beginning
of
2
.
The
δ
18
O
ct
values
for
RC2
are
in
general
higher
than
the
range
of
modern
stalactites
,
suggesting
that
γ
<
0
for
this
deposit
.
This
tells
us
that
decreasing
δ
18
O
ct
in
the
isotope
record
for
sample
RC2
can
identify
warming
periods
in
the
Quaternary
record
.
In
addition
,
δ
18
O
ct
values
increase
towards
full
glacial
conditions
,
also
confirming
that
γ
<
0
.
A
negative
gamma
appears
to
indicate
that
the
effective
temperature
dependence
of
δ
18
O
p
(
δ
18
O
of
precipitation
)
was
low
at
this
site
during
the
Quaternary
.
However
,
we
shall
see
that
other
explanations
are
also
possible
.
Negative
γ
values
are
observed
for
other
speleothem
records
from
the
eastern
to
central
United
States
(
Dorale
et
al.
,
1992
and
Thompson
et
al.
,
1974
)
.
Sample
RC20
has
lower
δ
18
O
ct
values
than
RC2
over
their
coeval
period
of
growth
,
values
which
are
not
significantly
different
from
the
modern
speleothems
;
this
suggests
that
γ
=
0
.
However
,
towards
the
end
of
its
record
(
the
end
of
glacial
MIS
4
)
δ
18
O
ct
increases
with
a
shift
towards
warmer
climate
suggesting
that
γ
>
0
.
Speleothem
RC2
grew
in
two
major
phases
differing
in
growth
rate
and
character
of
its
isotopic
variation
(
Fig.
4
)
.
The
first
growth
phase
extended
from
82
000
years
to
50
000
years
ago
at
a
mean
growth
rate
of
0.8
mm
per
thousand
years
,
representing
the
slowest
period
of
growth
.
The
slow
growth
rate
may
be
partially
responsible
for
the
smoother
records
of
δ
18
O
and
δ
13
C
in
this
first
growth
stage
compared
to
more
oscillatory
records
of
the
subsequent
phase
.
However
,
the
amplitude
of
variation
in
the
records
is
similar
.
There
is
a
general
trend
of
increasing
δ
18
O
ct
values
towards
a
maximum
at
around
55
000
years
.
This
trend
takes
place
during
the
transition
from
the
end
of
MIS
5
to
MIS
4
,
a
time
of
cooling
in
climate
over
this
period
,
confirming
that
γ
<
0
for
this
speleothem
.
The
most
prominent
feature
of
the
early
part
of
the
record
is
the
positive
shift
in
δ
18
O
ct
that
begins
approximately
71
000
years
ago
,
which
is
1000
to
3000
years
after
the
start
of
MIS
4
.
In
the
transition
from
MIS
4
to
MIS
3
,
there
is
a
general
decrease
in
δ
18
O
ct
coupled
with
an
increase
in
growth
rate
and
increase
in
the
amplitude
and
frequency
of
oscillations
in
the
isotopic
records
.
The
second
phase
of
growth
lasted
from
48
500
to
24
000
years
ago
.
The
speleothem
ceased
growing
approximately
3000
years
before
the
Late
Glacial
Maximum
(
LGM
)
,
the
oscillations
of
its
δ
18
O
signal
increasing
in
intensity
as
the
drip
sites
became
inactive
due
to
colder
temperatures
above
the
cave
.
This
phase
of
growth
covered
most
of
MIS
3
,
which
also
displays
the
strongest
millennial
scale
variation
in
the
GISP2
oxygen
isotope
record
from
Greenland
(
Grootes
et
al.
,
1993
,
Dansgaard
et
al.
,
1993
)
.
After
a
sharp
cold
event
at
∼
47
500
years
ago
,
major
peak-trough
cycles
in
δ
18
O
ct
with
a
mean
shift
of
2.0
‰
in
magnitude
occur
on
average
every
2000
–
3000
years
and
last
about
2800
years
.
The
growth
history
of
stalagmite
RC20
(
Fig.
5
)
is
partly
coeval
with
that
of
RC2
,
spanning
MIS
4
and
the
beginning
of
MIS
3
.
Although
it
grew
only
a
few
tens
of
meters
away
from
RC2
,
the
δ
18
O
ct
records
of
these
two
stalagmites
are
strikingly
different
.
First
,
we
have
already
noted
that
RC20
grew
350
times
faster
than
RC2
over
their
period
of
concurrent
growth
,
due
to
differing
depositional
modes
as
noted
and
probably
to
a
higher
rate
of
infiltration
.
Second
,
we
see
that
there
are
significant
differences
in
the
average
δ
18
O
ct
values
for
the
coeval
portions
of
each
speleothem
(
Fig.
6
)
.
δ
18
O
ct
of
RC20
ranges
from
zero
to
about
3.5
‰
lower
than
RC2
.
Third
,
we
note
that
there
are
short
(
millennial
to
centennial
)
time-scale
variations
in
both
δ
18
O
and
δ
13
C
in
RC20
that
are
not
seen
in
the
record
of
RC2
.
The
range
of
δ
18
O
variation
for
sample
RC20
is
3.9
‰
,
essentially
identical
in
magnitude
to
the
3.7
‰
found
in
RC2
,
but
recording
depleted
peaks
that
extend
below
modern
δ
18
O
ct
values
.
When
the
speleothem
started
growing
at
62
000
years
ago
,
δ
18
O
ct
values
were
in
the
most
depleted
part
of
the
range
until
about
59
000
years
ago
.
There
were
major
peaks
of
18
O
enrichment
indicating
warm
periods
at
59
250
,
58
750
,
58
000
,
56
500
,
and
55
000
years
ago
.
These
are
closely
spaced
intervals
,
indicating
that
these
records
were
capturing
rapid
environmental
variation
.
The
last
portion
of
the
record
shows
a
gradual
increase
of
δ
18
O
ct
values
after
54
000
years
ago
.
Assuming
that
γ
>
0
,
sample
RC20
is
displaying
rapid
cool
to
warm
oscillations
across
the
MIS
4
to
MIS
3
transition
and
into
stage
3
.
Additionally
,
the
oscillations
may
be
responding
to
changes
in
source
regions
for
precipitation
feeding
the
area
.
The
close
of
its
growth
between
54
000
and
50
000
years
ago
was
marked
by
a
trend
to
higher
δ
18
O
ct
values
,
indicative
of
warming
climate
;
this
is
matched
by
a
trend
to
slightly
more
negative
δ
13
C
values
over
the
same
interval
.
The
rising
δ
18
O
ct
values
may
also
be
responding
to
a
shift
in
storm
tracks
over
this
area
from
the
Arctic
air
mass
to
the
north
to
an
increase
of
inputs
from
Gulf
of
Mexico
air
masses
.
The
Gulf
of
Mexico
air
masses
have
a
higher
δ
18
O
of
precipitation
and
have
been
traced
in
previous
studies
of
pedogenic
carbonates
(
Amundson
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
5.3
.
Carbon
isotopes
Carbon
isotope
data
can
be
used
to
infer
changes
in
vegetation
,
although
the
complex
nature
of
the
soil
CO
2
and
infiltration
systems
can
make
this
difficult
(
Baker
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
General
trends
in
carbon
isotopes
support
the
conclusions
drawn
from
oxygen
isotope
data
.
The
δ
13
C
values
for
speleothems
RC2
and
RC20
average
between
−
7
and
−
8.5
‰
,
with
δ
13
C
values
<
−
6
‰
suggesting
the
presence
of
forest
cover
(
C
3
vegetation
)
during
the
time
of
their
growth
.
This
is
consistent
with
expected
cooler
temperatures
during
the
Wisconsin
glacial
period
.
The
striking
decrease
of
about
−
3
‰
after
59
000
years
ago
in
the
RC20
δ
13
C
record
reflects
a
similar
,
but
later
shift
of
vegetation
from
C
4
to
C
3
at
Crevice
Cave
from
warmer
prairie
to
cooler
forest
cover
(
Dorale
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
The
cooling
marked
in
the
RC20
record
precedes
that
of
Crevice
Cave
by
approximately
5000
years
,
but
this
is
likely
due
to
the
higher
latitude
and
closer
proximity
of
Reed
’s
Cave
to
the
Laurentide
Ice
Sheet
(
LIS
)
margin
.
The
surface
vegetation
over
Reed
’s
Cave
would
respond
sooner
to
advances
in
the
LIS
and
associated
cooling
.
For
the
period
of
coeval
growth
,
δ
13
C
is
almost
constant
for
sample
RC2
at
ca
.
−
7
‰
whereas
δ
13
C
varies
in
RC20
in
short-term
,
low-amplitude
oscillations
similar
to
those
seen
in
δ
18
O
ct
.
The
RC20
δ
13
C
record
supports
δ
18
O
ct
evidence
of
differing
hydrologic
pathways
for
the
two
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothem
deposition
sites
.

Discussion
6.1
.
Intrasite
isotopic
differences
When
we
compare
the
two
oxygen
isotope
records
over
the
limited
period
when
both
speleothems
were
being
deposited
,
we
see
a
difference
in
values
of
δ
18
O
(
Fig.
6
)
:
the
average
δ
18
O
ct
value
of
RC2
is
1.4
‰
greater
than
that
of
RC20
.
The
carbon
isotopes
are
offset
as
well
,
but
the
average
δ
13
C
values
of
the
two
samples
only
differ
by
0.4
‰
(
Fig.
6
)
.
The
different
appearances
of
the
isotope
records
for
the
two
stalagmites
can
be
explained
in
part
by
the
difference
in
growth
rates
and
morphology
.
The
reduced
variability
in
the
early
part
of
RC2
record
is
partly
due
to
the
slower
deposition
rate
from
reduced
calcium
ion
excess
and
our
inability
to
resolve
the
high-frequency
variations
in
δ
18
O
and
δ
13
C
values
for
these
compact
growth
layers
.
These
two
speleothems
were
deposited
less
than
10
m
apart
far
inside
the
cave
and
will
thus
have
experienced
the
same
temperature
histories
.
Therefore
,
their
differences
in
isotopic
composition
must
be
due
to
differences
in
the
composition
of
the
drip
waters
from
which
they
grew
.
The
higher
growth
rate
for
RC20
may
indicate
a
higher
discharge
rate
or
difference
in
calcium
ion
concentrations
.
Changes
in
calcium
ion
concentration
are
affected
by
soil
–
water
and
rock
–
water
interactions
and
are
not
explicitly
linked
to
changes
in
discharge
.
In
relatively
dry
climates
such
as
that
above
Reed
’s
Cave
,
a
ten-fold
or
even
one
hundred-fold
increase
of
drip
rate
may
occur
without
equivalent
dilution
of
the
calcium
ion
excess
(
Dreybrodt
and
Buhmann
,
1991
)
.
Changes
in
the
vegetation
cover
can
also
affect
growth
rates
in
speleothems
,
but
it
is
difficult
to
quantify
this
effect
for
Quaternary
age
deposits
.
Lower
residence
time
of
infiltration
waters
in
the
vadose
zone
can
reduce
equilibration
of
dissolved
CO
2
with
soil
CO
2
and
give
higher
δ
13
C
values
,
especially
if
rapid
recharge
bypasses
the
soil
zone
altogether
through
fissures
open
to
the
surface
.
Rapid
bypass
can
also
limit
any
evaporation
that
can
take
place
in
the
vadose
zone
which
can
give
increased
δ
18
O
values
in
deposited
calcite
(
Amundson
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
This
alone
can
not
account
for
the
difference
in
average
δ
18
O
of
the
feed
waters
to
the
two
sites
.
Seasonality
of
water
recharge
can
have
a
large
impact
on
the
average
δ
18
O
at
a
particular
drip
site
,
due
to
the
large
seasonal
variation
in
δ
18
O
p
of
up
to
15
‰
,
which
is
expected
to
occur
at
sites
in
this
climatic
zone
(
Rozanski
et
al.
,
1993
)
.
The
lower
average
δ
18
O
of
sample
RC20
may
be
because
drip
water
was
biased
to
winter
precipitation
,
e.g.
as
snowmelt
waters
,
while
recharge
to
RC2
was
not
.
Based
on
its
much
higher
growth
rate
,
we
may
also
assume
that
the
drip
rate
at
the
site
of
formation
of
RC20
was
higher
and
therefore
variations
in
the
isotopic
composition
of
infiltration
water
due
to
seasonal
bias
may
have
been
retained
in
the
drip
waters
forming
the
speleothem
calcite
.
By
contrast
,
slower
drips
at
the
site
of
RC2
may
represent
a
more
homogeneous
average
of
summer
and
winter
infiltration
.
Evidence
of
intra-cave
isotopic
variability
in
Holocene
speleothems
from
Norway
is
suggested
to
result
from
differences
in
percolation
pathways
and
effects
of
surface
vegetation
and
topography
on
these
waters
(
Linge
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
A
long-term
,
detailed
investigation
of
intra-cave
dripwater
variability
is
needed
before
these
theories
can
be
confirmed
.
Seasonal
bias
in
recharge
can
also
influence
the
value
of
γ
for
a
site
,
since
climate-controlled
changes
in
preferential
delivery
of
low
-
or
high-δ
18
O
waters
to
a
drip
site
can
influence
the
relationship
between
δ
18
O
ct
and
climate
.
This
could
account
for
the
apparent
difference
in
the
sign
of
γ
for
RC2
and
RC20
.
Independent
evidence
for
the
existence
of
intra-cave
,
inter-site
differences
in
δ
18
O
of
drip
waters
lies
in
our
measurements
of
drips
currently
entering
the
cave
,
which
differ
between
drip
sites
by
as
much
as
5
‰
.
It
is
conceivable
that
such
inter-site
differences
could
have
existed
during
the
Pleistocene
as
well
.
The
reasons
for
these
differences
in
mean
δ
18
O
of
drip
water
are
not
well
understood
,
and
presumably
relate
to
subtle
differences
in
the
routes
followed
by
recharge
water
from
the
surface
to
cave
drip
sites
.
Terrain
and
vegetation
differences
above
the
cave
could
have
led
to
differences
in
the
proportion
of
winter
vs.
summer
precipitation
entering
the
cave
.
An
alternative
explanation
is
that
modern
drip
paths
have
been
highly
disturbed
by
quarrying
activities
.
Soil
has
been
removed
from
the
quarry
surface
and
reduced
on
the
flanks
in
preparation
for
extension
of
the
quarry
.
The
impact
may
have
widened
variability
in
the
isotopic
composition
of
the
drips
.
This
makes
the
direct
comparison
of
modern
and
Quaternary
dripwaters
impossible
,
but
the
drips
from
the
New
Formations
room
gave
more
depleted
values
of
−
12
to
−
13.5
‰
.
This
may
be
more
representative
of
modern
values
as
the
calculated
calcite
–
water
pair
temperatures
(
9.8
±
2.4
°
C
)
were
close
to
modern
measured
average
temperature
(
8
°
C
)
.
The
smoother
record
of
RC2
over
the
interval
of
coeval
growth
with
RC20
may
indicate
that
feed
water
to
RC2
was
spending
a
long
time
in
the
recharge
zone
,
permitting
long-term
homogenization
of
waters
and
an
absence
of
seasonal
bias
.
Higher
variability
of
the
record
for
RC20
as
well
as
its
much
faster
growth
rate
are
consistent
with
rapid
infiltration
times
at
this
site
.
The
high
frequency
variation
of
δ
18
O
ct
prior
to
the
gradual
increase
at
54
000
years
ago
is
similar
to
fluctuations
seen
over
the
same
interval
in
Soreq
Cave
stalagmites
(
Fig.
7
)
.
There
is
a
negative
shift
of
3
‰
in
δ
13
C
at
59
000
years
ago
that
is
synchronous
with
warming
in
the
marine
record
(
Martinson
et
al.
,
1987
)
and
precedes
a
similar
but
larger
shift
in
δ
13
C
at
Crevice
Cave
(
Fig.
8b
;
Dorale
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
The
isotopic
record
for
sample
RC2
shows
frequency
of
oscillations
dissimilar
to
that
of
sample
RC20
during
their
coeval
period
of
growth
.
RC2
exhibits
higher
frequency
oscillations
after
50
000
years
ago
.
This
reinforces
the
idea
that
growth
rate
may
be
responsible
for
the
differences
in
the
two
records
over
their
coeval
period
of
growth
.
After
50
000
years
ago
,
the
measured
growth
rate
for
RC2
also
increases
by
over
an
order
of
magnitude
to
more
closely
resemble
that
of
RC20
.
In
addition
,
the
range
of
δ
18
O
ct
increases
to
−
8.5
to
−
12.2
‰
,
not
unlike
the
−
9.0
to
13.0
‰
range
for
RC20
.

Comparison
to
other
proxies
There
are
few
terrestrial
climate
proxy
records
for
the
pre-LGM
Wisconsin
glacial
period
in
North
America
,
particularly
in
regions
that
were
covered
by
or
close
to
the
margins
of
the
LIS
.
There
is
little
evidence
of
Dansgaard
–
Oeschger
oscillations
in
the
mid-continental
regions
(
Leuschner
and
Sirocko
,
2000
)
.
Lake
cores
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Black
Hills
are
limited
almost
entirely
to
the
Holocene
period
,
as
are
published
records
of
speleothem
deposits
from
neighboring
states
.
Heinrich
events
4
and
2
(
H4
and
H2
)
may
be
matched
with
cold
peaks
marked
by
positive
excursions
in
the
RC2
oxygen
isotope
time
series
at
41
000
and
24
000
years
ago
,
respectively
,
coinciding
with
the
major
late
Pleistocene
glacier
advances
in
western
North
America
(
Fig.

;
Clark
and
Bartlein
,
1995
)
.
An
important
record
from
Crevice
Cave
,
Missouri
(
Dorale
et
al.
,
1998
)
,
overlaps
periods
of
growth
in
both
of
the
Reed
’s
Cave
samples
and
is
one
of
the
few
other
continental
records
of
interstadial
events
in
North
America
.
Specifically
,
interstadial
events
between
60
000
and
56
000
years
are
present
in
both
Crevice
Cave
and
sample
RC2
(
Fig.
8
)
.
There
is
also
a
corresponding
depletion
in
δ
18
O
ct
in
the
transition
from
MIS
4
to
3
starting
at
57
000
years
ago
in
the
Crevice
Cave
samples
and
Reed
’s
Cave
sample
RC2
.
The
δ
18
O
ct
record
for
speleothems
of
Soreq
Cave
,
Israel
,
has
features
similar
to
some
seen
in
the
Reed
’s
Cave
records
during
the
Wisconsin
glacial
period
(
Fig.
7
)
.
The
comparison
shows
major
global
events
that
can
be
recognized
in
both
isotope
records
.
Local
effects
are
revealed
as
differences
in
smaller
scale
oscillations
.
A
∼
2.5
‰
enrichment
of
18
O
during
late
MIS
5a
and
into
MIS
4
occurs
from
80
000
to
65
000
years
ago
in
both
Soreq
Cave
and
sample
RC2
.
High
frequency
and
high
amplitude
oscillations
in
δ
18
O
ct
are
seen
in
both
Soreq
Cave
and
sample
RC20
.
Positive
excursions
in
the
Soreq
Cave
δ
18
O
ct
record
that
may
represent
Heinrich
events
5
and
2
at
46
ka
and
25
ka
,
respectively
,
are
well
expressed
in
the
δ
18
O
ct
record
for
sample
RC2
.
The
Soreq
record
is
influenced
by
the
isotopic
composition
of
feed
waters
from
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
which
would
produce
localized
effects
not
seen
in
the
Black
Hills
.
The
general
agreement
between
the
Soreq
Cave
δ
18
O
ct
record
and
the
longer
record
in
sample
RC2
is
evidence
that
distant
speleothems
can
be
recording
the
same
relative
changes
in
global
temperature
.
The
difficulty
of
interpreting
carbon
isotope
records
is
attributed
to
complex
interactions
such
as
soil
respiration
and
carbonate
dissolution
in
the
aquifer
systems
overlying
the
cave
(
Baker
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
The
primary
cause
of
δ
13
C
variation
is
likely
changes
in
surface
vegetation
density
and
distribution
and
the
concordant
changes
in
soil
CO
2
abundance
and
isotopic
composition
.
The
residence
time
of
water
in
the
vadose
zone
can
also
affect
δ
13
C
values
in
speleothem
calcite
,
with
lower
δ
13
C
as
the
percolating
waters
fully
equilibrate
with
soil
CO
2
.
This
could
be
recording
a
shift
from
C
3
to
C
4
vegetation
,
but
it
is
difficult
to
explain
with
only
a
∼
1
‰
change
in
δ
13
C
in
sample
RC2
.
The
δ
13
C
trend
for
RC20
is
relatively
stable
except
for
the
abrupt
3
‰
depletion
at
59
000
years
ago
that
corresponds
to
a
similar
but
chronologically
offset
depletion
in
the
Crevice
Cave
carbon
isotope
record
(
Fig.
8b
)
.
This
warm
interval
is
reflected
in
the
oxygen
isotope
records
in
both
RC2
and
RC20
.

Power-spectrum
analysis
of
the
isotope
records
Spectral
analysis
of
paleoclimate
time
series
can
reveal
periodicity
in
proxy
records
.
Deep-sea
sediment
records
from
the
North
Atlantic
(
Bond
et
al.
,
1999
,
Bond
et
al.
,
1997
and
Bond
et
al.
,
1992
)
and
Greenland
ice
core
records
(
Dansgaard
et
al.
,
1993
)
show
strong
millennial
scale
cyclicity
in
addition
to
the
well-established
Milankovitch
cycles
.
The
possible
global
extent
of
these
signals
has
been
established
from
records
in
ocean
sediments
in
the
Santa
Barbara
Basin
(
eastern
Pacific
Ocean
)
,
the
Indian
Ocean
,
in
continental
paleovegetation
proxies
from
the
Pacific
Northwest
,
and
in
the
Vostok
ice
cores
(
Alley
et

,
Whitlock
and
Grigg
,
1999
and
Anderson
et

)
.
Comparison
to
periodicity
in
other
speleothem
records
can
help
us
determine
if
these
are
local
and/or
proxy
specific
cycles
or
if
they
are
truly
recording
the
Dansgaard
–
Oeschger
events
.
The
power
spectra
from
the
two
speleothems
are
in
closer
agreement
than
the
oxygen
isotope
time
series
(
Fig.
9
)
.
The
RC2
record
does
not
agree
well
with
the
GISP2
record
in
the
time
domain
but
they
agree
well
in
the
frequency
domain
.
This
is
consistent
with
global
linkage
but
not
at
the
level
of
individual
events
.
The
spectra
show
similar
peaks
although
their
power
varies
.
There
is
a
7650-year
cycle
in
the
full
time
series
for
stalagmite
RC2
,
which
agrees
very
well
with
average
spacing
of
7980
years
for
Heinrich
events
0
–
5
using
the
median
of
several
reported
ages
compiled
by
Anderson
et
al.
(
2000
)
.
Shorter
1500-year
and
1600-year
cycles
are
present
in
both
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothems
but
do
not
show
a
strong
power
relative
to
the
other
peaks
in
RC2
when
computed
within
its
full
time
series
.
Better
resolution
of
these
cycles
is
seen
when
the
8000-year
,
20
000-year
and
41
000-year
peaks
are
removed
(
Fig.
9
,
lighter
curve
)
.
Because
there
is
temporal
variability
in
the
speleothem
oxygen
isotope
record
and
in
both
growth
rate
and
climate
over
time
,
spectra
were
obtained
for
the
different
phases
of
growth
in
the
two
speleothems
.
Power
spectra
for
the
full
oxygen
isotope
time
series
for
RC2
and
RC20
have
peaks
at
the
1000
–
2000-year
periodicity
,
but
they
are
below
the
95
%
significance
level
.
For
the
periods
50
000
–
24
000
years
ago
and
50
000
–
30
000
years
ago
in
speleothem
RC2
,
there
is
significant
periodicity
at
both
8000
years
and
1600
years
(
Fig.
9
)
,
while
the
faster
growth
rate
of
RC20
allows
us
to
observe
cyclicity
with
a
period
of
about
1000
years
;
even
higher
frequency
oscillations
are
evident
in
the
δ
13
C
record
of
RC20
.
This
millennial-scale
cyclicity
supports
the
notion
that
there
were
periods
of
higher
instability
in
climate
during
the
last
glacial
cycle
.
Spectral
analysis
of
the
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothems
provides
additional
evidence
that
the
cave
is
responding
to
a
mechanism
that
is
affecting
climate
on
a
hemispheric
and
likely
a
global
scale

Conclusions
This
paper
presents
well-dated
records
of
δ
18
O
ct
for
speleothems
for
central
North
America
during
the
Wisconsin
glacial
period
.
We
investigated
coeval
speleothems
that
had
offsets
in
δ
18
O
;
they
show
that
different
drip
sites
in
a
cave
may
not
behave
similarly
.
The
agreement
of
the
two
Reed
’s
Cave
speleothems
with
interstadial
events
in
North
American
terrestrial
records
,
frequency
of
isotopic
variation
in
deep-sea
sediment
records
and
δ
18
O
ct
and
δ
13
C
variations
in
other
speleothems
confirms
that
some
global
climate
signals
are
being
recorded
.
Major
shifts
in
climate
from
interglacial
to
glacial
conditions
in
the
mid-continent
are
displayed
in
both
Reed
’s
Cave
and
Crevice
Cave
,
Missouri
,
but
the
local
conditions
have
significant
influence
on
the
small
scale
variations
in
the
δ
18
O
ct
record
.
The
two
partially
coeval
speleothems
from
this
cave
display
strikingly
different
isotopic
records
,
showing
that
different
drip
sites
in
a
cave
may
respond
differently
to
climate
change
.
Differing
speleothem
morphology
may
also
exert
control
on
variable
isotopic
composition
between
the
coeval
records
.
During
the
period
of
simultaneous
deposition
,
the
temperature
response
(
d
(
δ
18
O
ct
)
/
dT
)
,
or
γ
,
of
the
two
speleothems
has
opposite
signs
,
probably
as
a
result
of
seasonal
bias
in
the
recharge
of
drip
water
to
one
of
the
samples
or
by
hydrology
of
each
specific
drip
site
.
Correlation
of
periodicity
found
in
the
speleothem
oxygen
isotope
records
with
periodicity
in
Greenland
ice
cores
supports
the
proposal
that
millennial-scale
variation
is
initiated
in
the
North
Atlantic
but
transmission
of
this
signal
is
highly
complicated
.
The
mixed
oceanic
–
atmospheric
conveyance
results
in
asynchronous
timing
of
these
events
in
different
proxies
,
but
their
common
periodicity
indicates
a
similar
forcing
mechanism
.
The
ages
for
Heinrich
events
as
revealed
by
North
Atlantic
and
European
proxy
records
appear
to
be
occurring
at
the
same
time
,
but
it
is
not
likely
that
the
effects
of
iceberg
discharges
on
ocean
circulation
directly
affect
temperatures
and
precipitation
in
the
mid-continent
.
Rather
,
it
is
more
likely
that
these
reflect
rapid
changes
in
the
size
and
extent
of
the
Laurentide
ice
sheet
,
which
would
have
affected
atmospheric
circulation
quickly
and
could
have
produced
correspondingly
high
frequency
signals
in
the
speleothem
records
.
