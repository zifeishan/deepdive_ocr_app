radiolarian
Abstract
In
order
to
observe
the
silicification
process
of
polycystine
radiolarians
,
we
tried
to
culture
Streblacantha
cf.
circumtexta
with
the
addition
of
dissolved
silica
(
final
concentration
10
μM
)
and
f/2
culture
medium
from
25th
,
Nov.
to
27th
,
Nov.
,
2009
.
During
our
session
of
observation
,
one
cell
of
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
formed
siliceous
fragments
in
the
extracapsulum
part
of
the
protoplasm
,
which
were
subsequently
ejected
.
A
total
of
94
siliceous
fragments
were
thus
expelled
from
the
cell
by
using
the
low-contrast
thin
(
LCT
)
pseudopodia
.
Similar
siliceous
fragments
were
often
found
in
the
extracapsulum
of
many
pylonioid
spumellarians
,
suggesting
they
did
also
secret
isolated
siliceous
fragments
.
Pylonioids
may
silicify
continuously
,
and
the
normal
growth
rate
of
the
siliceous
skeleton
is
maintained
by
the
disposal
activity
of
excess
silification
.

Introduction
Silicification
processes
of
polycystine
radiolarians
(
marine
holoplanktonic
Rhizaria
)
(
Krabberød
et
al.
,
2011
)
have
been
discussed
and
hypothesized
for
more
than
a
century
(
e.g.
,
Haeckel
,
1862
)
.
Since
the
development
of
the
geometrical
symmetry
in
radiolarians
was
discerned
by
Haeckel
(
1887
)
,
several
silicification
models
have
been
proposed
.
The
physical
model
of
Thompson
(
1942
)
is
the
best
known
amongst
them
;
it
interprets
the
tetrapod
spicular
form
of
the
polycystine
genus
Callimitra
as
being
formed
following
the
same
physical
process
as
the
formation
of
soap
bubbles
in
froth
.
This
model
has
been
widely
cited
in
scientific
books
;
however
,
the
observation
of
cytoplasmic
structure
using
transmission
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
revealed
that
the
siliceous
matter
of
polycystines
is
deposited
inside
a
silica
deposition
vacuole
(
SDV
)
that
was
formed
with
a
functional
membrane
,
silicalemma
(
Anderson
,
1994
)
.
The
formation
process
of
polycystine
skeletons
is
currently
understood
following
examination
of
the
skeletons
in
various
growth
stages
(
Suzuki
,
2006
)
,
incomplete
growth
shells
(
Anderson
et
al.
,
1987
and
Anderson
et
al.
,
1988
)
and
cross-sections
of
skeletons
(
Hurd
and
Theyer
,
1977
and
Nishimura
,
1990
)
.
Although
several
flat-shaped
polycystines
,
like
Dictyocoryne
truncatum
,
appear
to
have
grown
during
laboratory
culture
(
e.g.
,
Matsuoka
and
Anderson
,
1992
)
,
no
direct
documentation
of
the
formation
of
skeletons
exists
as
yet
for
polycystines
with
the
exception
of
Anderson
(
1983
:
p.
127
)
who
gave
a
brief
account
of
light
microscopic
observations
of
the
spine
growth
in
a
living
radiolarian
.
In
order
to
directly
observe
the
skeletogenesis
of
living
polycystines
,
we
participated
in
November
2009
in
the
11th
Radiolarian
Observation
Tour
of
Living
Radiolarians
at
Sesoko
Island
,
hosted
by
Atsushi
Matsuoka
(
Niigata
University
)
.
In
this
tour
,
we
continuously
observed
the
behavior
of
several
radiolarian
cells
in
f/2
culture
medium
(
a
widely
used
seawater
medium
designed
for
growing
coastal
marine
organisms
)
with
the
addition
of
dissolved
silica
(
final
concentration
10
μM
)
.
During
our
3-day
culturing
experiment
,
a
polycystine
radiolarian
species
,
Streblacantha
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jørgensen
)
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
,
appeared
to
undergo
skeletogenesis
where
siliceous
particles
abruptly
appeared
.
Many
siliceous
particles
were
formed
during
our
session
of
observation
,
which
were
subsequently
expelled
from
the
cell
through
the
tip
of
elongated
pseudopodia
.
This
behavior
,
documented
in
this
paper
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
,
was
so
slow
that
we
needed
a
10
×
-
speed
video
movie
(
real
60
min
were
converted
to
6
min
)
to
fully
capture
it
.
We
examined
how
many
siliceous
fragments
were
ejected
,
whether
they
were
newly
formed
or
whether
they
simply
originated
from
the
breakage
of
siliceous
portions
of
the
skeleton
,
we
also
examined
whether
the
behavior
of
the
cell
was
related
to
the
formation
of
the
siliceous
fragments
.

Material
and
methods
The
living
radiolarians
examined
in
our
study
were
collected
from
the
surface
seawater
(
0

with
a

)
,
and
observed
in
the
Sesoko
Station
,
Tropical
Biosphere
Research
Center
,
University
of
the
Ryukyus
.
The
polycystine
cells
were
isolated
under
an
inverted
microscope
and
binocular
stereo
microscope
with
a
Pasteur
pipette
,
and
were
transferred
into
a
chamber
of
a
cell
culture
plate
with
16
mL
of
0.45
μm
,
filtered
seawater
emended
with
f/2
culture
medium
and
silicate
ion
(
final
concentration
:
10
μM
)
.
A
total
of
10
cells
of
different
species
were
incubated
together
in
the
same
culture
chamber
of
a
cell
culture
plate
to
compare
them
under
the
same
conditions
from
November
25th
to
Nov
27th
,
2009
.
Of
these
radiolarians
,
a
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jørgensen
)
was
recorded
with
a
Hi-Vision
digital
video
camera
(
SONY
Handycam
HDR
–
8R
,
1080i
)
attached
to
an
inverted
light
microscope
(
Olympus
CK2
)
.
The
total
of
nearly
continuous
video
recording
time
was
close
to
23
h
from
November
26th
to
Nov
27th
,
2009
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
.
Because
its
motility
was
too
slow
to
be
recognized
in
a
video
at
the
normal
speed
,
the
recorded
video
data
was
converted
to
a
10
×
-
speed
video
movie
(
real
60
min
=
6
min
)
using
a
video-editing
software
,
Corel
Ulead
VideoStudio
11
Plus
for
Microsoft
Windows
.
The
PDMPO-experiment
introduced
in
this
paper
was
realized
a
year
before
,
November
25th
,
2008
,
during
the
10th
Radiolarian
Observation
Tour
(
hosted
by
Matsuoka
Atsushi
)
.
PDMPO
is
an
acronym
of
a
fluorescent
compound
that
accumulates
in
acidic
cell
compartments
,
2
-
(
4-pyridyl
)
-5
-
[
(
4
-
(
2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl
)
methoxy
)
-
phenyl
]
oxazole
(
PDMPO
)
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
PDMPO
is
accumulated
with
silica
under
acidic
conditions
,
and
the
newly
developed
silica
skeletons
display
a
green
fluorescent
light
.
The
picked
cells
were
put
into
a
glass
tube
with
16
mL
of
seawater
filtered
with
a
0.45
μm
membrane
filter
.
The
PDMPO
(
final
concentration
:
1.0
μM
)
was
dissolved
in
20
mL
of
percolated
seawater
in
advance
,
and
then
added
into
the
glass
tube
with
polycystine
cells
.
These
tubes
were
incubated
under
red
and
blue
LED
lights
for
12
h
and
in
dark
for
12
h
at
26
°
C
.
After
the
incubation
,
the
samples
were
fixed
with
a
5
%
formalin
solution
.
The
fixed
materials
were
kept
in
5
°
C
prior
to
observation
.
To
observe
the
stained
condition
with
PDMPO
,
the
material
was
dropped
on
a
glass
slide
and
covered
with
a
cover
glass
.
Four
lines
of
vaseline
were
spread
on
each
side
of
the
cover
glass
to
prevent
it
from
crushing
the
radiolarian
specimen
.
All
slides
were
observed
with
an
epifluorescence
microscope
(
AX-80
,
Olympus
)
with
UV-excitation
(
WU
:
BP330
–
385
,
DM400
,
BA420
)
,
and
images
of
selected
cells
were
digitally
captured
with
a
CCD
camera
(
DXM-1200
,
Nikon
)
.
The
physiological
ecology
of
radiolarians
kept
in
a
laboratory
without
natural
light
is
expressed
occasionally
with
some
specific
movements
,
which
may
be
related
to
daily
cycles
(
e.g.
,
Anderson
,
1983
and
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
However
,
additional
evidence
is
needed
to
understand
the
daily
cycle
in
radiolarians
.
As
the
cell
observed
in
this
experiment
appears
to
be
active
during
in
daytime
and
inactive
at
night
,
this
paper
will
denote
physiological
events
at
real
time
,
instead
of
elapsed
time
from
the
beginning
of
our
observation
.

Results
Ten
cells
of
four
polycystine
species
were
incubated
for
3
days
with
silica-supplemented
seawater
;
only
one
of
them
(
a
cell
of
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
)
formed
siliceous
fragments
and
then
ejected
them
.

manner
.
Therefore
,
only
observations
of
S
.
cf.

will
be
described
in
this
paper
.
Long
periods
of
continuous
observation
were
allowed
since
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
was
in
general
most
of
the
time
adhered
with
its
pseudopodia
to
the
chamber
.
3.1
.
Cell
characteristics
The
examined
cell
of
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
was
difficult
to
be
taxonomically
identified
due
to
the
skeletal
internal
structure
hidden
behind
a
thick
,
opaque
cytoplasm
(
Figs.
3.1
–
3.9
)
.
As
shown
on
Fig.
3
,
the
cell
looks
very
different
,
depending
on
its
orientation
.
In
some
views
,
the
overall
shape
of
the
skeleton
appears
to
be
quadrate
(
Figs.
3.1
,
3.2
)
,
ellipsoidal
(
Figs.
3.4
,
3.5
)
,
oblong
(
Fig.
3
.7
)
,
or
even
triangular
(
Fig.
3
.8
)
.
A
girdle-like
pore
frame
was
also
recognized
(
e.g.
,
Fig.
3
.9
)
.
Such
irregular
appearances
are
commonly
encountered
in
the
taxa
belonging
to
the
Superfamily
Pylonioidea
(
=
Pyloniacea
sensu
De
Wever
et
al.
,
2001
,
see
ICZN2000
)
.
However
,
no
apparent
gates
and
no
cupolas
related
to
pylonioid
girdles
are
present
in
it
,
suggesting
that
it
belongs
to
Tetrapyle
,
Tholonium
,
or
other
closely
related
genera
.
The
skeleton
of
the
cell
is
also
characterized
by
the
presence
of
larger
pores
.
Nearly
identical
morphotypes
to
our
cell
were
in
general
identified
as
Streblacantha
circumtexta
(
Jørgensen
)
in
the
west
Pacific
(
e.g.
,
Chen
and
Tan
,
1996
)
.
The
type
specimens
illustrated
in
Jørgensen
(
1905
)
are
somewhat
different
from
our
cell
in
the
absence
of
long
stout
radial
spines
,
so
that
we
tentatively
identified
this
cell
as
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jørgensen
)
.
The
cytoplasm
of
the
cell
consists
of
a
brownish
red
intracapsulum
and
whitish
translucent
extracapsulum
,
just
inside
the
siliceous
skeleton
(
Figs.
4.1
–
4.9
)
.
The
extracapsulum
inside
the
siliceous
test
appears
granular
,
with
granules
moving
slowly
inside
the
extracapsulum
throughout
the
session
of
observation
.
The
intracapsulum
is
spherical
in
shape
,
but
the
inner
brownish
red
endoplasm
changed
in
shape
between
spherical
and
elliptical
.
The
translucent
extracapsulum
fully
enclosed
the
skeleton
in
the
early
hours
of
the
day
(
Fig.
3
and
Fig.
4
)
but
shrunk
progressively
afterwards
(
Fig.
3
and
Fig.
4
)
.
The
pseudopodia
of
the
cell
belong
to
three
different
types
,
described
here
for
the
first
time
:
high-contrast
,
very
thick
pseudopodia
(
HCT
pseudopodia
,
herein
)
,
low-contrast
thin
pseudopodia
(
LCT
pseudopodia
,
herein
)
and
a
single
thick
axoflagellum
(
Figs.
4.1
–
4.5
)
.
HCT
pseudopodia
are
easily
visible
in
a
wide
range
of
contrasts
using
an
optical
microscope
.
During
the
observation
period
,
the
HCT
pseudopodia
extended
40
–
80
μm
out
of
the
surface
of
the
intracapsulum
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
;
they
had
a
very
strong
adhesive
attachment
capacity
except
of
their
mobile
stage
of
these
pseudopodia
.
Intra-cytoplasmic
granules
moved
continuously
by
slow
cyclosis
up
and
down
the
length
within
each
pseudopodium
.
LCT
pseudopodia
are
barely
visible
under
the
high-contrast
viewing
conditions
.
The
degree
of
contrast
of
even
the
same
pseudopodium
is
gradually
changeable
between
LCT
and
HCT
pseudopodia
in
a
variable
case
like
the
rhythmic
extension
and
contraction
movement
of
pseudopodia
(
e.g.
,
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
,
Suzuki
,
2005
and
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
The
LCT
pseudopodia
are
in
general
slightly
longer
(
70
–
140
μm
in
length
)
than
HCT
pseudopodia
(
40
–
80
μm
)
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
.
The
length
of
pseudopodia
is
measured
from
the
distance
between
the
observational
distal
end
of
pseudopodia
and
the
surface
of
the
intracapsulum
,
and
is
always
shown
as
total
length
in
both
text
and
figures
.
Differing
from
the
HCT
pseudopodia
,
the
LCT
pseudopodia
have
no
apparent
adhesive
capacity
.
The
observed
specimen
has
a
single
axoflagellum
.
The
axoflagellum
of
this
specimen
appears
thicker
than
the
LCT
pseudopodia
and
thinner
than
HCT
pseudopodia
;
it
is
easily
differentiated
from
other
pseudopodia
when
the
LCT
pseudopodia
are
contracted
.
The
axoflagellum
is
generally
immobile
(
150
μm
in
length
)
,
but
it
occasionally
shrinks
down
to
60
μm
in
length
.
When

Cytological
behavior
of
pseudopodia
The
cytological
behavior
of
pseudopodia
was
continuously
recorded
from
the
early
morning
on
26th
Nov.
,
2009
to
the
early
morning
of
the
27th
Nov.
,
2009
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
.
Pseudopodia
occasionally
elongated
and
contracted
8:30
AM
and
16:00
PM
on
26th
Nov.
,
2009
.
Both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
occasionally
extended
90
–
170
μm
and
170
–
350
μm
in
length
,
respectively
at
variable
intervals
from
20
to
60
min
.
Following
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
(
2001
)
,
the
shortened
condition
,
the
inception
of
the
extended
condition
,
the
ultimate
longest
condition
,
and
the
inception
of
pseudopodial
contraction
are
named
as
S
-
,
E
-
,
L
-
and
C-modes
,
respectively
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Most
of
the
time
the
cell
was
in
S-mode
(
Fig.
4
.1
)
for
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Columns
C
and
D
on
Fig.
1
)
while
the
axoflagellum
was
in
L-mode
(
Fig.
4
.1
)
(
Column
E
on
Fig.
1
)
.
L-mode
duration
in
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Fig.
4
.4
)
was
very
short
(
<
1
min
)
,
and
simultaneously
the
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
were
in
the
E
-
,
L
-
and
C-modes
(
Figs.
4.2
–
4.5
)
.
Although
the
adhesive
capacity
and
other
characteristics
are
different
between
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
,
the
continuous
transformations
from
E-mode
to
C-mode
through
L-mode
occurred
simultaneously
in
both
the
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Figs.
4.4
,

;
9:30

)
,
with
few
exceptions
.
The
axoflagellum
occasionally
changed
from
L-mode
to
S
-
or
C-mode
before
the
start
of
E-mode
in
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
a
typical
case
was
recorded
at
9:05
–
9:30
AM
and
10:20
–
10:30
AM
on
Fig.
1
)
,
and
the
axoflagellum
simultaneously
extended
as
E-mode
at
the
same
time
that
E-mode
of
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
occurred
(
ca
.
9:30
AM
,

AM
,
11:55
AM
,
12:35
PM
,

PM
,

PM
on

)
.
A
series
of
movements
from
C-mode
to
E-mode
via
very
short
or
no
S-mode
intervals
repeated
after
around
13:25
for
the
axoflagellum
.
The
activity
of
all
three
pseudopodia
ceased
after
16:20
PM
on
26th
,
Nov.
2009
,
and
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
remained
in
the
S-mode
while
the
axoflagellum
was
in
the
L-mode
most
of
the
time
.
3.3
.
Siliceous
fragments
As
shown
on
Figs.
4.6
–
4.9
,
solid
siliceous
fragments
of
10
to
30
μm
in
size
were
found
adjacent
to
the
cell
during
the
observation
days
.
A
total
of
94
fragments
were
recorded
on
the
digital
video
.
The
fragments
are
trifurcate
,
ramiform
or
plate-like
;
some
others
appear
to
be
part
of
a
pore-frame
.
More
fragments
might
have
existed
since
we
were
able
to
observe
the
cell
from
one
side
only
.
All
identifiable
siliceous
fragments
were
digitally
captured
and
numbered
in
sequence
(
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
)
.
It
is
interesting
that
a
new
fragment
was
abruptly
observable
.
It
was
generally
difficult
for
us
to
eyewitness
the
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
.
The
upper
side
of
the
cell
easily
rotated
sideways
and
new
siliceous
fragments
were
generally
hidden
behind
the
cell
.
However
,
the
formation
process
of
a
fragment
(
fragment
ID
8
)
was
successfully
recorded
in
the
digital
video
(
Figs.
5.1
–
5.21
)
.
It
is
best
understood
by
winding
back
the
video
record
.
The
fragment
moved
out
of
a
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
around
09:26
AM
on
26th
,
Nov.
(
Figs.
5.20
,
5.21
)
.
The
fragment
was
first
recognizable
inside
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
around
09:25
AM
(
Figs.
5.15
–
5.19
)
.
Prior
to
this
time
,
no
distinguishable
outline
was
discernible
regardless
of
the
orientation
of
the
cell
(
Figs.
5.9
–
5.14
)
,
but
shadow
that
may
possibly
be
the
fragment
is
distinguishable
in
the
earlier
record
(
Figs.
5.6
–
5.8
)
.
Similar
phenomena
were
recorded
for
other
fragments
,
but
the
timing
of
the
start
of
the
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
was
not
precisely
determined
due
to
rotation
of
the
cell
during
the
observation
.
There
are
four
possible
sources
of
fragments
:
•
debris
in
the
cell
;
•
breakage
of
pieces
from
pre-existing
cell
skeleton
;
•
newly
formed
fragments
during
our
observation
session
;
•
captured
polycystines
as
prey
.
Since
the
cell
slowly
rotated
many
times
during
the
recording
period
,
we
could
confirm
many
times
that
there
was
an
absence
of
fragments
.
This
rotation
also
allowed
us
to
compare
the
same
face
of
the
test
at
different
times
.
Several
fragments
look
like
a
portion
of
a
pore-frame
approximately
10
–
20
μm
in
size
(
Fig.
4
.7
)
,
but
as
the
pores
of
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
are
much
larger
(
ca
.
30
–
40
μm
)
breakage
is
not
a
likely
source
of
fragments
.
The
addition
of
new
pore
frame
would
have
been
easily
recognized
if
it
happened
,
but
we
did
not
observe
it
.
It
is
unlikely
to
be
sourced
from
captured
polycystines
as
prey
because
we
have
never
encountered
captured
polycystines
by
other
polycystines
in
our
observed
thousands
living
specimens
during
our
fifteen
years
experience
.

Disposal
activity
of
siliceous
fragments
The
most
important
discovery
in
this
observation
is
the
disposal
activity
of
siliceous
fragments
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
.
The
sequential
record
of
each
fragment
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
disposal
movement
is
shown
in
the
B
column
of
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
.
In
most
cases
the
disposal
movement
occurred
in
clusters
of
several
siliceous
fragments
after
the
spontaneous
extension
of
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
and
shrinkage
of
the
axoflagellum
(
9:30
–
9:50
,
12:00
–
12:10
,
13:40
–
13:50
,
14:10
–
14:05
,
14:35
–
14:40
,
15:10
–
15:10
on
Fig.
1
)
.
The
siliceous
fragments
were
always
disposed
by
movement
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
A
siliceous
fragment
moved
outside
by
elongation
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
,
or
moved
occasionally
forward
or
backward
from
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
.
Once
a
fragment
apparently
moved
outside
,
this
fragment
was
never
withdrawn
back
to
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
.
The
fragment
in
this
condition
was
generally
attached
to
the
distal
end
of
tens
of
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Figs.
6.1
–
6.3
)
.
When
the
LCT
pseudopodia
extended
to
a
total
length
of
ca
.
100
μm
,
fragments
were
gently
detached
and
the
LCT
pseudopodia
slid
away
of
the
released
fragment
.
When
the
cell
started
to
dispose
of
siliceous
fragments
,
only
the
LCT
pseudopodia
with
this
fragment
lengthened
,
while
the
remaining
LCT
pseudopodia
maintained
an
independent
pattern
of
movement
.
Disposed
siliceous
fragments
remained
on
the
bottom
of
the
culture
container
(
Fig.
6
.4
)
.
The
duration
of
such
individual
episodes
of
disposal
activity
varied
from
a
few
minutes
to
30
min
.

Discussion
One
may
wonder
whether
observation
made
in
the
laboratory
correspond
to
normal
cell
behaviour
.
This
question
may
not
have
been
addressed
adequately
in
this
study
.
However
,
in
spite
of
this
uncertainty
,
we
believe
it
is
worthwhile
reporting
and
discussing
it
because
this
is
the
first
direct
observation
of
a
polycystine
forming
silicified
fragments
.
4.1
.
Slow
silicification
of
polycystines
This
culture
experiment
was
initially
planned
to
encourage
silicification
by
adding
dissolved
silica
;
we
had
initially
planned
to
verify
newly
silicified
parts
with
a
fluorescent
compound
,
PDMPO
(
for
a
detailed
description
of
the
method
see
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
and
Ogane
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
spite
of
numerous
efforts
made
by
radiolarian
workers
to
observe
living
polycystines
,
nobody
has
directly
observed
skeleton
formation
with
the
exception
of
Anderson
(
1983
:
p.
127
)
.
Three
possibilities
may
explain
this
:
•
polycystine
cells
die
within
a
few
days
during
laboratory
culture
(
e.g.
,
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
)
;
•
they
can
not
form
a
skeleton
because
of
shortage
of
dissolved
silica
in
natural
sea
water
;
•
skeletogenesis
is
a
very
slow
process
.
The
cytological
behavior
of
polycystines
is
commonly
slow
or
nearly
static
except
for
very
occasional
abrupt
movements
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
,
Suzuki
,
2005
and
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
Thus
,
long-term
continuous
observations
of
a
single
cell
with
a
video
recorder
are
essential
to
study
their
physiological
ecology
.
During
200-times
fast
screening
observation
(
60
min
=
18
s
;
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
of
our
recording
of
the
radiolarian
behavior
we
realized
that
the
siliceous
fragments
formation
is
an
extremely
slow
process
(
the
film
attached
is
18
s
and
it
corresponds
to
an
1
h
in
reality
)
.
The
formation
model
of
siliceous
skeletons
consists
of
primary
growth
(
PG
)
,
secondary
growth
(
SG
)
and
skeletal
thickening
growth
(
STG
)
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
PG
forms
the
principal
framework
of
skeletons
and
SG
is
the
formation
of
a
new
siliceous
part
on
the
already
existing
skeleton
(
Anderson
and
Bennett
,
1985
)
.
STG
thickens
the
already
existing
skeletons
but
never
forms
a
new
skeleton
part
like
PG
and
SG
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
We
conclude
that
the
silicification
by
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
reported
in
this
paper
is
a
kind
of
SG
.
4.2
.
Patchwork
silicification
and
disposal
activity
Our
conclusion
about
patchwork
silicification
is
inferred
based
on
our
observation
of
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
.
It
is
unlikely
that
these
siliceous
fragments
originated
from
pre-existing
broken
particles
around/on
the
cell
,
because
the
cell
expelled
at
least
94
fragments
.
If
these
94
fragments
were
already
present
,
our
23-hours
continuous
video
record
would
have
shown
the
cell
as
being
surrounded
by
them
.
It
is
also
unlikely
that
the
cell
had
broken
its
own
skeleton
,
because
we
have
not
detected
any
evidence
of
breakage
.
Why
should
the
cell
dispose
of
the
siliceous
fragments
?
Two
points
need
to
be
evaluated
:
the
added
silica
concentration
in
the
culture
medium
,
and
other
observational
data
about
the
formation
of
new
skeleton
parts
via
PG
or
SG
.
The
cell
we
studied
was
incubated
in
silica-supplemented
filtered
sea
water
for
about
3
days
.
We
added
10
μM
silica
,
which
is
an
appropriate
concentration
if
by
reference
to
concentrations
of
10
–
35
μM
at
thermocline
water
depths
in
meridional
sections
through
the
Pacific
Ocean
(
e.g.
,
Plate
1.2.5
(
c
)
in
Siedler
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
This
silica
concentration
is
not
considered
to
be
sufficient
to
enhance
silicification
by
the
cell
,
although
the
additional
dissolved
silica
may
motivate
it
to
form
new
siliceous
fragments
.
Sugiyama
and
Anderson
(
1997
)
reported
no
significant
differences
between
silica-supplemented
and
control
groups
in
an
experimental
study
:
rather
,
the
cells
died
in
extraordinarily
silica-rich
seawater
(
150
μM
,
3
–
10
times
larger
than
the
normal
sea
water
)
.
Additional
supportive
evidence
is
shown
on
Figs.
7.4
–
7.6
.
A
cell
of
Lithelius
sp
.
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
collected
from
the
East
China
Sea
where
we
routinely
collect
living
radiolarians
,
including
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
,
was
observed
to
be
associated
with
siliceous
fragments
(
Fig.
7
.4
)
.
When
this
cell
was
dyed
with
PDMPO
to
tag
the
silification
sites
and
observed
under
the
epifluorescent
microscope
(
Fig.
7
.5
)
,
the
pre-existing
siliceous
fragment
and
its
own
skeleton
did
not
emit
with
PDMPO
,
implying
no
silification
at
these
sites
(
black
arrows
on
Fig.
7
.4
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
cytoplasmic
site
with
barely
observable
fragments
of
pore
frame
emitted
bright
green
fluorescence
(
white
arrows
on
Figs.
7.4
,
7.5
)
.
It
is
quite
difficult
to
illustrate
these
barely
observable
fragments
of
the
pore
frame
due
to
their
very
faint
appearance
,
but
the
position
of
these
fluorescing
parts
can
be
confirmed
when
these
two
figures
are
overlapped
as
shown
on
Fig.
7
.6
.
If
siliceous
fragments
can
be
formed
in
the
normal
sea
water
conditions
,
other
cells
must
have
many
siliceous
fragments
in
their
extracapsulum
.
Referring
to
our
archive
photos
of
living
radiolarians
,
we
found
that
cells
belonging
to
the
Superfamily
Pylonioidea
are
commonly
associated
with
siliceous
fragments
in
their
extracapsulum
(
Figs.
7.1
,
7.2
)
.
Similar
siliceous
fragments
are
also
found
in
a
flat-shaped
polycystine
(
Fig.
7
.3
)
.
There
is
no
evidence
about
the
origin
of
the
siliceous
fragments
in
these
cells
,
but
we
have
commonly
observed
in
laboratory
that
the
pylonioids
with
HCT
pseudopodia
hold
siliceous
fragments
.
Furthermore
,
it
is
noted
that
almost
all
the
siliceous
fragments
are
always
located
inside
the
HCT
pseudopodial
bundle
.
This
observation
suggests
that
pylonioids
possessing
HCT
pseudopodia
can
form
siliceous
fragments
as
a
normal
process
of
silicification
.
We
speculate
that
this
energy-wasting
behaviour
is
related
to
a
difference
of
silicification
patterns
among
polycystines
.
Ogane
et
al.
(
2010
)
pointed
out
that
the
silicification
process
of
some
polycystines
is
an
intermittent
process
.
By
contrast
,
our
cell
,
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
,
showed
non-stop
silicification
,
while
the
other
three
non-pylonioid
species
incubated
with
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Didymocyrtis
tetrathalamus
tetrathalamus
,
Spongaster
tetras
tetras
and
Haliommilla
capillaceum
)
are
known
to
exhibit
intermittent
growth
patterns
(
Matsuoka
and
Anderson
,
1992
,
Sugiyama
and
Anderson
,
1997
and
Ogane
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
These
specimens
survived
for
3
days
with
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
in
the
same
chamber
of
the
cell
culture
plate
,
but
no
growth
of
any
kind
was
observed
.
The
polycystines
with
non-stop
silicification
like
Pylonioidea
do
patchwork
silicification
and
disposal
activity
so
as
not
to
become
overgrown
,
differing
from
the
species
with
intermittent
growth
.
The
normal
condition
in
seawater
is
very
low
concentrations
of
dissolved
silica
(
Siedler
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
Silicification
requires
a
source
of
energy
to
concentrate
and
solidify
this
highly
dilute
chemical
substance
from
a
dissolved
state
(
e.g.
,
Schroeder
,
1999
)
.
This
raises
the
question
on
the
adaptive
value
of
apparently
regulating
“
excessive
silica
deposition
”
by
secreting
large
fragments
and
expelling
them
.
It
may
be
difficult
to
explain
that
this
phenomenon
is
a
control
mechanism
for
over-silicification
,
given
the
very
dilute
quantities
of
silica
in
seawater
,
because
organisms
would
be
better
off
simply
to
stop
accumulating
more
silica
if
it
was
in
excess
.
These
processes
are
usually
tightly
controlled
biologically
,
and
normally
remain
active
only
enough
to
complete
the
biomineralized
shell
or
skeleton
.
This
phenomenon
,
as
observed
in
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
and
other
pylonioids
,
would
be
a
remarkably
non-adaptive
way
for
a
living
organism
to
control
biomineralization
.
It
may
be
a
genetic
abnormality
that
has
mutated
to
turn
on
a
silicification
process
in
the
extracapsulum
that
has
become
uncontrolled
.
There
are
some
similar
examples
of
genetic
errors
in
humans
,
such
as
the
uncontrolled
deposition
of
boney
deposits
in
the
skin
and
soft
tissues
of
the
body
(
osteoma
cutis
)
.
This
is
undoubtedly
a
genetic
anomaly
leading
to
what
we
would
call
in
humans
an
in-born
error
of
metabolism
.
The
evolutionary
origin
of
non-stop
silification
in
the
pylonioids
with
HCT
pseudopodia
ought
to
shed
light
on
the
causes
of
diversification
of
pylonioids
since
the
Paleocene
(
De
Wever
et
al.
,
2001
)
.

Function
of
cytoplasm
Various
physiological
functions
of
the
cytoplasm
have
been
studied
in
Collodaria
,
Spumellaria
and
Nassellaria
(
Anderson
,
1983
,
Matsuoka
,
2007
and
Sugiyama
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
We
have
recognized
a
new
silicification
function
in
the
extracapsulum
based
on
our
supplemented
silica
experiment
with
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
;
Figs.
5.1
–
5.21
)
,
PDMPO-experiment
with
Lithelius
sp
.
(
Figs.
7.4
–
7.6
)
,
and
archive
photos
of
Pylonioidea
(
Figs.
7.1
,
7.2
)
.
The
cytoplasmic
structure
with
a
silicification
function
is
called
the
silicalemma
(
Anderson
,
1994
)
.
The
cell
examined
in
our
experiment
has
three
types
of
pseudopodia
,
namely
HCT
pseudopodia
,
LCT
pseudopodia
and
an
axoflagellum
.
HCT
pseudopodia
have
always
a
strong
adhesive
function
and
they
frequently
adhere
to
the
bottom
of
the
culture
chamber
.
This
adhesive
function
of
HCT
pseudopodia
helped
us
to
observe
the
specimen
continuously
for
23-hours
because
the
cell
did
not
move
in
the
culture
chamber
most
of
time
.
This
adhesive
function
of
HCT
pseudopodia
is
only
effected
for
a
limited
time
,
because
the
cell
occasionally
separated
from
the
bottom
and
floated
in
the
sea
water
of
the
culture
chamber
.
LCT
pseudopodia
were
used
to
expel
siliceous
fragments
.
When
LCT
pseudopodia
started
to
throw
a
siliceous
fragment
away
,
a
single
LCT
pseudopodium
or
a
few
LCT
pseudopodia
elongated
distally
with
the
siliceous
fragment
attached
on
the
tip
of
these
LCT
pseudopodia
.
The
siliceous
fragment
abruptly
detached
and
sank
down
without
any
rotation
of
the
siliceous
fragment
.
The
siliceous
fragment
simply
detached
from
the
adhesive
tip
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
or
was
discarded
with
a
small
portion
of
the
cytoplasm
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
Only
the
tip
of
LCT
pseudopodia
is
adhesive
.
We
do
not
recognize
adhesive
function
in
all
the
other
parts
of
LCT
pseudopodia
except
for
its
tip
.
This
means
that
the
polycystine
can
control
the
adhesive
condition
in
different
portions
along
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
function
of
the
axoflagellum
is
still
unknown
.
Several
previous
papers
contain
comments
on
the
function
of
pseudopodia
to
support
a
planktonic
lifestyle
,
the
maintenance
of
buoyancy
,
the
sudden
contraction
against
attack
,
and
enhancement
of
protoplasmic
streaming
inside
the
endoplasm
in
solitary
spherical
polycystines
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
,
Suzuki
,
2005
and
Matsuoka
,
2007
)
.
The
functions
of
capturing
and
securing
a
prey
are
also
known
to
be
mediated
by
pseudopodia
in
both
Nassellaria
(
Sugiyama
et
al.
,
2008
)
and
solitary
spherical
polycystines
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
)
.
Pseudopodial
behavior
during
predation
,
sudden
contraction
against
attack
,
enhancement
of
protoplasmic
streaming
and
other
functions
could
be
explained
by
a
mechanical
response
to
simple
tactile
stimulation
.
However
,
the
pseudopodia
of
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
did
not
react
to
our
attempts
at
artificial
mechanical
stimulation
such
as
tapping
the
culture
plate
.
Although
the
exact
mode
of
radiolarian
pseudopodial
sensation
and
response
is
unknown
,
it
is
clear
that
the
cell
controls
complex
pseudopodial
activity
such
as
the
intricate
behavior
documented
here
in
our
research
.

Conclusions
A
single
cell
of
S
.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
formed
at
least
94
siliceous
fragments
inside
the
extracapsulum
as
a
kind
of
SG
mode
.
After
residing
inside
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
,
they
moved
outside
of
the
HCT
pseudopodia
by
the
elongation
of
a
few
LCT
pseudopodia
and
then
were
ejected
to
fall
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
culture
chamber
.
These
movements
were
documented
via
a
movie
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
.
Pseudopodia
are
very
important
organelles
to
sustain
survival
.
They
are
divided
here
,
for
the
first
time
,
into
two
types
,
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
.
HCT
pseudopodia
are
named
due
to
their
high-contrast
thick
form
,
and
are
generally
shorter
than
(
low-contrast
thin
)
LCT
pseudopodia
.
HCT
pseudopodia
have
an
adhesive
function
while
LCT
pseudopodia
can
move
actively
.
These
pseudopodia
do
not
react
to
simple
mechanical
stimulation
,
but
to
more
complex
,
specific
stimulation
.
