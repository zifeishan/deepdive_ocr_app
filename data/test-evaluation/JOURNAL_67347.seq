Carbon
isotope
geochemistry
of
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
transition
Abstract
Carbon
isotope
records
for
inorganic
and
total
organic
carbon
(
TOC
)
as
well
as
for
individual
organic
biomarkers
show
two
positive
excursions
in
the
Late
Frasnian
with
comparable
shape
and
amplitude
in
δ
13
C
.
The
positive
shifts
in
δ
13
C
can
be
correlated
with
the
deposition
of
the
Kellwasser
horizons
.
The
inorganic
carbon
isotope
excursions
are
explained
by
an
enhanced
organic
carbon
burial
that
is
expected
to
lower
the
concentration
of
oceanic
dissolved
CO
2
.
TOC
δ
13
C
values
do
not
exhibit
a
larger
shift
than
that
recorded
by
inorganic
carbon
δ
13
C
values
;
this
is
unexpected
since
a
decrease
in
the
dissolved
CO
2
concentration
should
result
in
lower
carbon
isotope
fractionation
during
photosynthesis
(
ε
p
)
.
δ
13
C
values
of
presumed
algal
biomarkers
(
low-molecular-weight
n
-
alkanes
,
pristane
,
phytane
)
,
although
offset
by
∼
2.5
‰
,
exhibit
essentially
identical
records
as
TOC
,
and
confirm
this
unexpected
result
.
It
is
proposed
that
high
atmospheric
and
oceanic
CO
2
concentrations
during
the
Devonian
resulted
in
maximum
photosynthetic
fractionation
.
Any
change
in
the
CO
2
concentration
would
thus
not
affect
ε
p
.
As
such
,
δ
13
C
of
primary
organic
carbon
and
δ
13
C
carb
will
exhibit
parallel
excursions
.
The
data
imply
that
carbon
isotopes
and
the
relationship
between
ε
p
and
[
CO
2
]
will
not
be
effective
to
study
changes
in
p
CO
2
levels
during
the
Devonian
since
CO
2
concentrations
were
too
high
.

Introduction
Middle
to
Upper
Devonian
coral
–
stromatoporoid
reefs
form
one
of
the
most
extensive
reef
constructions
in
Earth
history
that
vanishes
in
the
Late
Frasnian
during
one
of
the
most
prominent
mass
extinction
events
in
Earth
history
.
The
causes
of
this
extinction
event
remain
debated
.
Whereas
some
authors
(
McLaren
,
1970
,
Wang
et
al.
,
1991
,
Wang
et
al.
,
1996
and
McGhee
,
1996
)
invoked
a
bolide
impact
as
ultimate
cause
,
others
favor
the
idea
of
anoxia
and/or
climatic
changes
as
explanation
for
the
decline
of
the
reef
ecosystem
(
Copper
,
1986
,
Thompson
and
Newton
,
1988
,
Buggisch
,
1991
and
Joachimski
and
Buggisch
,
1993
)
.
In
order
to
unravel
perturbations
in
the
global
carbon
cycle
during
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
transition
,
carbon
isotope
analyses
have
been
performed
on
carbonate
rocks
.
Wang
et
al.
,
1991
,
Wang
et
al.
,
1996
and
Zheng
et
al.
,
1993
measured
negative
δ
13
C
carb
excursions
that
were
interpreted
to
be
induced
by
a
bolide
impact
affecting
primary
productivity
in
surface
waters
(
Strangelove
ocean
)
.
The
investigation
of
several
European
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
sections
by
McGhee
et
al.
,
1986
,
Buggisch
,
1991
and
Joachimski
and
Buggisch
,
1993
,
and
Joachimski
et
al.
(
1994
)
revealed
two
positive
carbon
isotope
excursions
of
+3
‰
that
coincide
with
the
deposition
of
two
black
bituminous
horizons
,
the
so-called
Kellwasser
horizons
.
The
top
of
the
upper
horizon
marks
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
.
These
positive
carbon
isotope
excursions
do
not
support
the
idea
of
a
sudden
decrease
in
primary
productivity
in
the
Late
Frasnian
.
The
opposite
patterns
in
δ
13
C
carb
led
to
the
statement
that
the
carbon
isotope
record
across
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
is
not
well
constrained
(
Hallam
and
Wignall
,
1997
)
.
This
paper
presents
carbon
isotope
records
for
inorganic
and
total
organic
carbon
(
TOC
)
as
well
as
for
individual
organic
biomarkers
for
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
sections
from
different
paleogeographic
units
.
The
main
scope
of
this
contribution
is
to
constrain
the
carbon
isotope
pattern
of
the
Late
Frasnian
and
Early
Famennian
and
to
unravel
variations
in
the
carbon
cycling
of
the
ocean
–
atmosphere
system
that
may
have
affected
Late
Devonian
marine
life
.

Investigated
sections
In
addition
to
carbon
isotope
records
published
earlier
(

,
we
present
carbon
isotopic
data
for
sections
from
the
Eifelian
Mountains
(
Germany
)
,
Poland
,
Morocco
,
Australia
and
North

(

McWhae
Ridge
and
Casey
Fall
’s
(
Canning
Basin
,
Australia
)
Continuous
Frasnian
–
Famennian
sections
are
developed
in
fore-reef
slope
positions
of
the
Devonian
‘
Great
Barrier
Reef
’
of
the
Canning
Basin
(
NW
Australia
)
.
This
Devonian
reef
complex
forms
an
exhumed
linear
belt
over
∼
350
km
long
that
was
fringing
a
landmass
of
Precambrian
rocks
(
Kimberley
Block
)
or
islands
of
Precambrian
or
Ordovician
rocks
(
Playford
et
al.
,
1989
)
.
A
sea-level
fall
in
the
latest
Frasnian
to
earliest
Famennian
resulted
in
subaerial
exposure
and
erosion
of
the
Frasnian
reef
complexes
.
However
,
sedimentation
continued
without
any
break
on
the
marginal
reef
slopes
and
in
the
basins
.
The
McWhae
Ridge
and
Casey
Fall
’s
sections
are
located
a
few
kilometers
north
of
Great
Northern
Highway
,
98
km
southeast
along
the
road
from
Fitzroy
Crossing
.
Both
sections
were
described
in
detail
by
Playford
,
1980
,
Playford
,
1981
and
Becker
et
al.
,
1991
.
The
section
studied
on
the
west
side
of
McWhae
Ridge
corresponds
to
the
section
described
by
the
same
investigators
(
Playford
,
1980
,
Playford
,
1981
and
Becker
et
al.
,
1991
)
.
The
fine-grained
reddish
cephalopod
limestones
(
Virgin
Hill
Formation
)
are
composed
of
silty
bioclastic
wackestones
to
packstones
with
intercalated
microbial
carbonates
.
The
top
of
the
sampled
section
is
marked
by
the
Frutexites
bed
.
The
McWhae
Ridge
section
became
well-known
since
Playford
et
al.
(
1984
)
reported
anomalous
iridium
concentrations
in
a
ferruginous
stromatolite
bed
that
contains
the
microbial
fossil
Frutexites
.
A
time-equivalent
negative
carbon
isotope
excursion
(
Playford
et
al.
,
1984
)
and
the
fact
that
the
Frutexites
horizon
was
believed
to
be
at
or
close
to
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
heightened
speculation
that
an
impact
event
might
have
triggered
the
Late
Devonian
mass
extinction
(
Playford
et
al.
,
1984
)
.
However
,
biostratigraphic
dating
of
the
Frutexites
horizon
in
the
Early
crepida
Zone
by
Nicoll
and
Playford
(
1993
)
revealed
that
the
stromatolite
bed
and
the
enrichment
in
iridium
postdates
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
extinction
event
by
at
least
∼
1.5
Myr
.
The
succession
exposed
at
Casey
Fall
’s
is
relatively
condensed
in
comparison
to
the
McWhae
Ridge
section
.
The
limestones
are
characterized
by
reddish
silty
mudstones
at
the
base
and
bioturbated
bioclastic
wackestones
and
laminoid
pelletoidal
wackestones
to
packstones
in
the
upper
part
of
the
section
.
The
top
of
the
sampled
interval
at
Casey
Fall
’s
is
marked
by
microbial
carbonates
and
a
relatively
thin
Frutexites
bed
(
Fig.

)
.

Devil
’s
Gate
(
Nevada
,
USA
)
The
Devil
’s
Gate
section
is
located
in
central
Nevada
north
of
the
town
of
Eureka
(
Sandberg
and
Poole
,
1977
,
Sandberg
et
al.
,
1988a
and
Sandberg
et
al.
,
1988b
)
.
The
section
shows
a
transition
of
Early
Frasnian
shallow-water
carbonates
with
Amphipora
biostromes
at
the
base
into
deeper
subtidal
nodular
and
slope
carbonates
with
abundant
debris
flow
deposits
and
slump
structures
.
The
top
of
the
investigated
section
is
characterized
by
siltstones
with
intercalated
carbonates
.
The
latter
were
interpreted
as
distal
turbidites
deposited
in
the
subsiding
Pilot
shale
basin
(
Sandberg
et
al.
,
1988b
)
.

Bou-Ounebdou
(
Meseta
,
Morocco
)
The
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
section
Bou-Ounebdou
(
Lazreq
,
1999
)
is
exposed
near
the
village
of
M’rirt
(
Central
Meseta
,
located
at
the
highway
from
Khénifra
to
Azrou
)
and
is
characterized
by
a
succession
of
well-bedded
limestones
with
intercalated
calcareous
shales
(
Lazreq
,
1992
and
Lazreq
,
1999
)
.
The
limestones
are
composed
of
bioclastic
wackestones
to
packstones
with
abundant
cricoconarids
(
Frasnian
)
,
crinoid
ossicles
,
trilobite
and
pelecypod
fragments
as
well
as
cephalopods
.
Two
black
bituminous
horizons
were
biostratigraphically
identified
as
the
Lower
and
Upper
Kellwasser
horizons
(
Lazreq
,
1992
and
Lazreq
,
1999
)
.

.
Büdesheimer
Bach
(
Eifelian
Mountains
,
Germany
)
The
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
TOC
was
investigated
in
the
Büdesheimer
Bach
core
that
was
drilled
in
the
Prüm
syncline
of
the
Eifelian
Mountains
.
The
basinal
Frasnian
–
Famennian
sequence
consists
of
calcareous
gray
to
black
shales
with
intercalated
turbiditic
limestone
beds
.
Biostratigraphic
dating
of
the
section
is
difficult
since
conodonts
are
only
rarely
found
in
the
limestone
beds
(
Piecha
,
1994
)
.
A
tectonic
repetition
of
the
carbonate
bed
in
the
lower
part
of
the
investigated
succession
(
Fig.
3
)
was
assumed
based
on
lithology
and
conodont
association
in
the
two
carbonate
beds
(
Piecha
,
1994
)
.
The
conodont
color
alteration
index
is
around
1.5
which
points
to
a
minor
thermal
overprint
of
<
100
°
C.

Kowala
(
Holy
Cross
Mountains
,
Poland
)
The
Devonian
sequence
exposed
in
the
Holy
Cross
Mountains
was
deposited
on
a
carbonate
shelf
,
up
to
600
km
wide
,
that
was
bordering
the
Old
Red
Continent
to
the
south
and
stretching
from
Western
Europe
to
the
Ukraine
.
The
paleogeography
of
the
Holy
Cross
Mountains
during
the
Late
Devonian
is
characterized
by
the
central
Kielce
swell
,
the
Lysogóry
Basin
to
the
north
and
the
intra-shelf
Chęciny-Zbrza
Basin
to
the
south
.
Continuous
Frasnian
–
Famennian
deposits
were
deposited
in
the
Chęciny-Zbrza
Basin
with
Frasnian
and
Famennian
deposits
being
well
exposed
in
the
Kowala
quarry
(
Szulczewski
and
Racki
,
1996
and
Racki
and
Baliński
,
1998
)
.
The
investigated
sequence
developed
in
the
Kowala
quarry
is
dominated
by
black
carbonaceous
shales
with
intercalated
carbonate
beds
(
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
3
)
.
The
latter
are
interpreted
as
turbidite
deposits
derived
from
the
near-by
reefal
carbonate
platform
(
Kielce
swell
)
.
Due
to
the
predominance
of
black
carbonaceous
shales
,
the
Kellwasser
horizons
that
are
typically
developed
in
cephalopod
limestone
successions
deposited
on
submarine
swells
(
e.g.
in
Central
Europe
and
Northern
Africa
)
could
not
be
identified
lithologically
.

‰
to
+2
‰
.
This
positive
shift
in
δ
13
C
carb
correlates
with
the
deposition
of
black
bituminous
carbonates
and
shales
that
were
identified
as
being
time-equivalent
to
the
Lower
Kellwasser
Horizon
(
Lazreq
,
1999
)
.
In
the
Devil
’s
Gate
section
a
+2
‰
excursion
in
δ
13
C
carb
is
observed
in
the
latest
Early
rhenana
and
at
the
base
of
the
Late
rhenana
Zone
.
Sandberg
et
al.
(
1988b
)
positioned
the
boundary
between
the
Early
and
Late
rhenana
zones
in
the
upper
part
of
a
8-m-thick
calcareous
siltstone
bed
.
Since
the
siltstones
are
devoid
of
any
conodonts
,
the
stratigraphic
position
of
the
boundary
between
the
Early
and
Late
rhenana
zones
and
thus
the
exact
position
of
the
δ
13
C
carb
excursion
can
not
be
constrained
.
However
,
the
comparison
with
δ
13
C
carb
records
measured
in
other
sections
(
see
above
;
Joachimski
and
Buggisch
,
1993
)
suggests
that
this
excursion
in
δ
13
C
carb
is
time-equivalent
to
the
deposition
of
the
Lower
Kellwasser
Horizon
.
The
δ
13
C
carb
values
measured
on
the
intercalated
micritic
carbonate
beds
in
the
Kowala
section
are
slightly
lower
and
show
considerable
scatter
in
comparison
with
δ
13
C
carb
values
measured
in
pure
cephalopod
limestone
successions
described
above
(
Fig.
2
,
Table
1
)
.
In
addition
,
the
measured
δ
13
C
carb
record
does
not
show
a
distinct
positive
shift
in
δ
13
C
carb
at
the
boundary
.
Petrographic
investigation
of
the
carbonates
shows
that
the
micritic
matrix
shows
clear
evidence
for
intense
recrystallization
,
dolomitization
as
well
as
precipitation
of
pseudospar
predominantly
near
the
transition
into
the
calcareous
shales
(
Fig.
3
)
.
This
observation
suggests
that
early
diagenetic
recrystallization
and
dolomitization
may
have
reset
the
carbon
isotopic
signals
.
A
more
detailed
discussion
of
this
aspect
will
be
presented
below
.

Carbon
isotopic
composition
of
TOC
and
individual
biomarkers
The
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
TOC
was
investigated
in
the
Büdesheimer
Bach
core
(
Eifelian
Mountains
,
Germany
)
and
the
isotopic
composition
of
individual
biomarkers
was
analyzed
on
samples
from
Kowala
,
Poland
.
The
δ
13
C
TOC
record
measured
in
the
Büdesheimer
Bach
core
reveals
two
positive
excursions
of
+3
‰
(
Fig.
4
)
.
The
excursion
at
the
base
of
the
Late
rhenana
Zone
shows
a
double
peak
in
δ
13
C
TOC
which
supports
the
assumption
of
a
tectonic
repetition
of
the
two
carbonate
beds
at
the
base
of
the
Late
rhenana
Zone
.
The
second
increase
in
δ
13
C
TOC
correlates
with
dark
limestone
beds
that
were
considered
as
equivalents
of
the
Upper
Kellwasser
Horizon
(
Piecha
,
1994
)
.
The
isotopic
composition
of
TOC
and
individual
organic
biomarkers
was
determined
on
samples
from
the
basinal
Kowala
section
.
TOC
values
in
the
Kowala
section
range
from
0.2
to
6.4
%
with
most
samples
around
2
%
TOC
.
Higher
TOC
contents
are
observed
at
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
and
in
the
Late
rhenana
Zone
at
a
position
that
is
time-equivalent
with
the
Lower
Kellwasser
Horizon
.
The
organic
material
consists
of
75
–
95
%
bituminite
,
up
to
20
%
alginite
and
only
minor
amounts
of
vitrinite

A

occurs
near

of

that
corresponds
more
or
less
to
the

position
of

.
As
evidenced
in
the
Büdesheim
Bach
core
,
an
increase
in
δ
13
C
TOC
by
+3
‰
is
expected
(
Fig.

)
,
but
due
to
the
broader
sampling
interval
in
the
lower
part
of
the

,
this

Evaluation
of
the
δ
13
C
carb
record
Most
of
the
carbon
isotope
records
across
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
reported
in
this
study
or
in
the
literature
(
McGhee
et
al.
,
1986
,
Buggisch
,
1991
,
Joachimski
and
Buggisch
,
1993
,
Joachimski
et
al.
,
1994
,
Joachimski
,
1997
and
Wang
et
al.
,
1996
)
show
well
comparable
patterns
(
Fig.
2
,
Table
1
)
suggesting
that
the
two
positive
excursions
in
δ
13
C
carb
with
amplitudes
of
+3
‰
represent
the
global
signal
.
However
,
the
δ
13
C
carb
record
measured
in
the
Kowala
section
shows
no
prominent
shift
in
δ
13
C
carb
at
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
(
this
study
)
and
negative
excursions
in
δ
13
C
carb
of
−
3.5
‰
(
Wang
et
al.
,
1991
)
and
−
7.6
‰
(
Zheng
et
al.
,
1993
)
have
been
reported
for
a
Chinese
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
section
.
However
,
the
negative
δ
13
C
carb
excursions
in
China
as
well
as
the
δ
13
C
carb
record
from
Kowala
were
measured
on
carbonate
from
organic
carbon-rich
sediments
.
The
consumption
of
free
oxygen
in
organic
carbon-rich
sediments
will
initiate
anaerobic
conditions
and
organic
matter
decomposition
will
proceed
by
bacterial
sulfate
reduction
.
Bacterial
sulfate
reduction
is
expected
to
increase
pore-water
carbonate
saturation
state
in
case
bacterially
generated
HS
−
is
precipitated
as
iron
sulfide
(
Berner
,
1971
,
Ben-Yaakov
,
1973
and
Canfield
and
Raiswell
,
1991
)
:
equation
(
1
)
The
higher
carbonate
saturation
state
of
pore
water
may
result
in
cementation
of
the
carbonate
muds
and
precipitation
of
calcite
spar
.
Dependent
on
the
percentage
of
carbon
derived
from
the
respiration
of
organic
carbon
on
total
pore-water-dissolved
inorganic
carbon
(
DIC
)
,
pore-water
δ
13
C
DIC
will
become
more
or
less
depleted
in
13
C
.
As
a
consequence
,
precipitating
carbonate
will
have
low
δ
13
C
values
.
In
addition
,
the
decrease
in
the
pore-water
sulfate
concentration
as
a
consequence
of
bacterial
sulfate
reduction
may
favor
the
precipitation
of
dolomite
(
Baker
and
Kastner
,
1981
and
Baker
and
Burns
,
1985
)
.
Again
,
since
pore-water
DIC
will
be
depleted
in
13
C
due
to
the
contribution
of
13
C-depleted
carbon
from
the
oxidation
of
organic
matter
,
dolomite
precipitating
under
anaerobic
conditions
may
reflect
relatively
low
δ
13
C
values
.
The
turbiditic
carbonate
beds
exposed
in
the
Kowala
quarry
show
signs
of
intense
recrystallization
and
dolomite
precipitation
.
The
fact
that
we
observe
a
relatively
large
scatter
in
δ
13
C
carb
and
almost
no
increase
in
δ
13
C
carb
at
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
transition
is
explained
by
shallow-burial
lithification
and
recrystallization
of
the
carbonate
muds
during
anaerobic
oxidation
of
organic
matter
(
Coniglio
,
1989
)
.
This
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
the
δ
13
C
values
of
TOC
and
individual
organic
compounds
that
clearly
show
the
expected
+3
‰
shift
near
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
.
For
the
same
reasons
,
the
negative
δ
13
C
carb
excursions
measured
in
Chinese
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
sections
(
Wang
et
al.
,
1991
,
Wang
et
al.
,
1996
and
Zheng
et
al.
,
1993
)
are
interpreted
as
a
diagenetic
artifact
.
This
interpretation
is
strongly
supported
by
the
fact
that
well-preserved
brachiopod
shell
calcites
from
one
of
the
Chinese
sections
do
not
reveal
any
depletion
in
13
C
(
Hou
et
al.
,
1996
)
.
As
a
consequence
,
δ
13
C
carb
signals
from
organic
carbon-rich
intervals
have
to
be
evaluated
very
carefully
due
to
the
potential
contribution
of
isotopically
light
carbon
during
the
diagenetic
stabilization
of
the
carbonates
.
The
comparison
with
δ
13
C
carb
records
measured
on
carbonate-rich
limestone
successions
or
with
organic
carbon
isotope
records
may
help
to
identify
the
diagenetically
induced
shifts
in
δ
13
C
(
Table
2
)
.
In
summary
,
the
Late
Frasnian
and
Early
Famennian
inorganic
carbon
isotope
records
measured
on
carbonate-rich
sections
from
different
paleo-continents
reflecting
different
facies
show
two
positive
excursions
with
an
amplitude
of
around
+3
‰
(
Table
1
)
.
The
first
excursion
in
δ
13
C
carb
occurs
near
the
base
of
the
Late
rhenana
Zone
.
This
increase
in
δ
13
C
carb
can
be
correlated
with
the
deposition
of
the
Lower
Kellwasser
Horizon
on
submarine
rises
in
Central
Europe
and
Northern
Africa
.
The
decrease
in
δ
13
C
carb
to
pre-excursion
values
is
registered
shortly
above
the
Lower
Kellwasser
Horizon
.
The
upper
excursion
in
δ
13
C
carb
starts
in
the
Upper
linguiformis
Zone
just
below
the
base
of
the
Upper
Kellwasser
Horizon
.
High
δ
13
C
carb
values
are
observed
in
the
Early
and
Middle
triangularis
zones
.
In
most
sections
(
except
the
McWhae
Ridge
section
)
a
decrease
in
δ
13
C
carb
only
occurs
in
the
Middle
to
Early-Late
triangularis
Zone
.
The
fact
that
this
pattern
is
observed
in
all
investigated
sections
that
do
not
show
evidence
of
significant
diagenetic
overprint
supports
the
conclusion
that
the
above-described
pattern
reflects
global
variations
in
the
δ
13
C
of
the
oceanic
DIC
reservoir
.
5.2
.
Evaluation
of
the
TOC
and
biomarker
δ
13
C
records
The
δ
13
C
TOC
excursions
measured
in
the
Büdesheimer
Bach
core
and
the
Kowala
section
as
well
as
published
excursions
in
δ
13
C
TOC
from
Canada
and
the
Appalachian
Basin
(
Wang
et
al.
,
1996
and
Murphy
et
al.
,
2000
)
reflect
a
comparable
shape
and
amplitude
in
comparison
to
the
excursions
in
δ
13
C
carb
(
Table
2
)
.
Comparable
variations
in
δ
13
C
TOC
and
δ
13
C
carb
are
expected
since
a
change
in
the
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
DIC
will
not
only
affect
δ
13
C
of
bicarbonate
but
as
well
δ
13
C
of
dissolved
CO
2
which
represents
the
main
carbon
source
for
photosynthesis
.
Following
,
the
δ
13
C
TOC
record
seems
to
support
the
conclusion
that
the
isotopic
composition
of
oceanic
dissolved
DIC
changed
through
time
.
However
,
TOC
may
be
composed
of
organic
matter
from
various
sources
and
primary
isotopic
signatures
may
be
affected
by
secondary
contamination
,
heterotrophy
and
thermal
alteration
(
Hayes
et
al.
,
1989
,
Hayes
,
1993
and
Kenig
et
al.
,
1994
)
.
As
a
consequence
,
conclusions
concerning
variations
in
δ
13
C
DIC
that
are
based
on
δ
13
C
TOC
data
might
be
erroneous
.
These
secondary
effects
may
be
minimized
by
investigating
the
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
organic
molecules
derived
from
primary
marine
producers
that
may
give
a
more
reliable
record
of
changes
in
the
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
surface
water
DIC
(
Hayes
et
al.
,
1989
and
Pancost
et
al.
,
1997
)
.
Acyclic
isoprenoids
pristane
and
phytane
are
typically
interpreted
to
derive
from
the
phytol
side
chain
of
chlorophyll
(
Didyk
et
al.
,
1978
)
and
should
have
the
same
carbon
isotopic
composition
if
derived
from
the
same
source
.
The
comparison
of
pristane
,
phytane
and
n
-
C
18
δ
13
C
values
measured
in
the
Kowala
section
shows
that
phytane
is
on
average
enriched
in
13
C
by
0.5
‰
relative
to
pristane
,
whereas
n
-
C
18
is
on
average
depleted
in
13
C
by
0.3
‰
relative
to
phytane
(
Fig.
5
)
.
This
fact
may
point
to
a
minor
contribution
of
pristane
from
a
second
source
(
ten
Haven
et
al.
,
1987
and
Freeman
et
al.
,
1990
)
.
The
13
C
depletion
in
n
-
C
18
relative
to
phytane
is
small
compared
to
the
analytical
error
but
expected
(
Monson
and
Hayes
,
1982
)
and
suggests
that
n
-
C
18
and
phytane
derive
from
a
common
biological
source
.
As
such
,
phytane
,
n
-
C
18
and
to
some
extent
pristane
are
interpreted
to
reflect
primary
algal
inputs
(
Freeman
et
al.
,
1990
)
.
Hopanes
are
interpreted
as
compounds
derived
exclusively
from
precursors
in
cyanobacteria
,
methylotrophs
,
chemoautotrophic
and
heterotrophic
bacteria
(
Ourisson
et
al.
,
1982
;
Rohmer
et
al.
,
1992
)
.
The
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
the
C
30
17α
(
H
)
-
hopane
as
well
as
the
22S
C
31
17α
(
H
)
-
hopane
are
similar
but
slightly
enriched
in
13
C
in
comparison
to
δ
13
C
of
pristane
and
phytane
(
Fig.
5
)
.
The
relatively
heavy
hopane
δ
13
C
signals
exclude
methylotrophic
bacteria
as
potential
source
of
the
hopanes
(
Freeman
et
al.
,
1990
)
.
The
fact
that
the
hopane
δ
13
C
values
are
comparable
but
slightly
enriched
in
13
C
relative
to
algal

may
point
to
cyanobacteria
as
the
main
source
of
the
hopanes
(
Sakata
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Higher
δ
13
C
values
of
cyanobacterial
biomass
relative
to
algal
biomass
are
expected
due
to
the
smaller
photosynthetic
fractionation
factor
for
cyanobacteria
(
Sakata
et
al.
,
1998
and
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
1.5
‰
larger
amplitude
in
hopane
δ
13
C
relative
to
algal
δ
13
C
could
indicate
a
higher
proportion
of
heterotrophic

.
A
higher
proportion
of
bacterial

was
assumed
based
on
a
higher
hopane
abundance
at
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
interval
(
Joachimski
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
In

,
the

of

diaryl
isoprenoids
and
isorenieratane
(

;
Joachimski
et

)
,
carotenoid

specific
for
green

,
show
that
these
anaerobic
bacteria
thrived
near
the
oxic/anoxic

in
the
Kowala
Basin
(
Joachimski
et

,
2001
)
.
A
higher
proportion
of
heterotrophic
bacteria
consuming
algal
,
purple

,
and
13
C-enriched
green
sulfur
bacterial

,
might
explain
the
larger

in

δ
13
C
.
In
summary
,
the
carbon
isotopic
compositions
of
marine
photoautotroph

phytane
,

as
well
as

Interpretation
of
inorganic
and
organic
carbon
isotope
records
Inorganic
carbon
isotope
records
of
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
sections
show
two
shifts
of
+3
‰
during
the
Late
Frasnian
that
coincide
with
short-term
sea-level
rises
(
Johnson
et
al.
,
1985
)
and
the
deposition
of
black
shales
(
Kellwasser
horizons
)
.
This
carbon
isotope
pattern
is
recorded
globally
and
is
interpreted
to
reflect
changes
in
the
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
the
oceanic
DIC
reservoir
.
In
steady
state
(
larger
oceanic
carbon
residence
time
of
∼
100
kyr
)
,
surface
water
δ
13
C
is
determined
by
the
organic
fraction
of
the
total
carbon
burial
rate
,
the
photosynthetic
fractionation
factor
ε
p
(
fractionation
between
CO
2
and
primary
biomass
)
as
well
as
the
flux
and
isotopic
composition
of
riverine
carbon
input
.
On
shorter
time
scales
(
smaller
oceanic
carbon
residence
time
)
,
transients
may
be
developed
due
to
changes
in
the
carbon
burial
rate
or
primary
productivity
(
Kump
,
1991
)
.
In
order
to
evaluate
the
cause
of
the
recorded
changes
in
δ
13
C
carb
,
the
duration
of
the
positive
excursions
was
estimated
.
Using
the
revised
Devonian
time
scale
of
Tucker
et
al.
(
1998
)
and
assumptions
concerning
the
relative
duration
of
individual
conodont
zones
(
Sandberg
and
Ziegler
,
1996
)
,
the
duration
of
the
Early
and
Late
rhenana
,
linguiformis
and
Early
,
Middle
and
Late
triangularis
condont
zones
are
estimated
to
be
850
,
360
and
730
kyr
,
respectively
.
Knowing
the
thickness
of
sediments
deposited
during
the
respective
conodont
zones
and
assuming
constant
sedimentation
rates
,
the
duration
of
the
periods
characterized
by
higher
δ
13
C
carb
values
are
estimated
to
be
around
0.4
(
Lower
Kellwasser
)
and
1.0
–
1.5
Myr
(
Frasnian
–
Famennian
transition
)
.
The
duration
of
both
periods
is
longer
than
the
assumed
residence
time
of
oceanic
carbon
(
100
kyr
,
Kump
,
1991
)
.
Because
of
this
,
the
steady
state
solution
has
to
be
applied
,
suggesting
that
an
enhanced
organic
carbon
burial
rate
or
a
change
in
the
riverine
carbon
input
was
responsible
for
the
observed
δ
13
C
carb
shifts
(
Kump
and
Arthur
,
1999
)
.
In
steady
state
,
the
carbon
flux
entering
the
ocean
through
continental
weathering
(
F
w
)
has
to
be
balanced
by
the
burial
flux
of
organic
(
F
org
)
and
carbonate
carbon
(
F
carb
)
:
equation
(
2
)
According
to
Kump
(
1991
)
the
isotopic
mass
balance
can
be
written
as
:
equation
(
3
)
with
δ
w
=
riverine
δ
13
C
(
−
5
‰
,
Lasaga
et
al.
,
1985
)
and
δ
carb
=
carbonate
δ
13
C.
Δ
is
the
mean
isotopic
difference
between
carbonate
and
primary
organic
carbon
and
was
formerly
assumed
to
be
25
‰
(
Berner
,
1994
)
.
For
the
Late
Frasnian
,
δ
13
C
of
primary
organic
carbon
and
δ
13
C
carb
are
around
−
29
‰
to
−
30.5
‰
(
see
below
)
and
+1
‰
,
respectively
,
which
translates
into
a
Δ
value
of
around
30
‰
.
The
organic
carbon
burial
fraction
(
X
org
)
of
total
carbon
burial
may
be
calculated
by
combining
and
:
equation
(
4
)
Assuming
that
the
weathering
flux
F
w
and
the
riverine
isotopic
composition
δ
w
did
not
change
,
the
Late
Frasnian
+3
‰
shifts
require
that
the
organic
carbon
burial
fraction
increased
from
20
to
30
%
.
Taking
into
account
the
oceanic
carbon
reservoirs
size
and
carbon
fluxes
given
by
Kump
(
1991
)
,
these
increases
in
the
organic
carbon
burial
rate
result
in
an
excess
organic
carbon
sedimentation
of
1.6
×
10
18
and
4.6
×
10
18
mol
C
for
the
Lower
Kellwasser
and
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
transition
,
respectively
.
If
we
assume
that
the
riverine
flux
of
DIC
to
the
oceans
and
volcanic
CO
2
degassing
did
not
change
significantly
,
the
excess
organic
carbon
burial
is
expected
to
lower
CO
2
concentrations
in
surface
waters
,
and
,
since
surface
water
CO
2
content
is
on
a
global
scale
in
equilibrium
with
the
atmospheric
CO
2
concentration
,
climatic
cooling
is
expected
as
ultimate
consequence
(
e.g.
Arthur
et
al.
,
1988
)
.
The
isotopic
composition
of
inorganic
carbon
and
primary
organic
carbon
can
be
used
to
estimate
ancient
p
CO
2
levels
and
to
unravel
changes
in
atmospheric
p
CO
2
(
Popp
et
al.
,
1989
,
Hayes
et
al.
,
1989
,
Freeman
and
Hayes
,
1992
and
Pagani
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
This
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
isotopic
fractionation
of
13
C
during
photosynthesis
(
ε
p
)
is
a
function
of
extracellular
and
intracellular
CO
2
concentrations
(
Farquhar
et
al.
,
1982
)
.
The
isotopic
composition
of
primary
photosynthate
is
determined
by
the
isotopic
composition
of
the
carbon
source
and
by
the
photosynthetic
fractionation
factor
ε
p
.
ε
p
depends
on
the
concentration
of
oceanic
dissolved
CO
2
(
[
CO
2
]
)
and
physiological
factors
as
phytoplankton
growth
rate
(
μm
)
and
cell
geometry
(
Laws
et
al.
,
1995
,
Laws
et
al.
,
1997
,
Bidigare
et
al.
,
1997
,
Pancost
et
al.
,
1997
and
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Popp
et
al.
(
1998
)
showed
that
ε
p
and
μm
/
[
CO
2
]
are
negatively
correlated
and
that
species-specific
cell
geometry
determines
the
slope
of
the
regression
line
.
Assuming
that
phytoplankton
distributions
and
growth
rate
did
not
change
in
the
Late
Frasnian
and
Early
Famennian
,
the
inferred
lowering
of
surface
water
[
CO
2
]
is
expected
to
result
in
a
decrease
in
ε
p
values
,
and
primary
organic
carbon
δ
13
C
should
exhibit
a
larger
shift
than
carbonate
δ
13
C.
However
,
δ
13
C
TOC
as
well
as
δ
13
C
of
primary
organic
carbon
(
e.g.
n
-
C
18
and
phytane
)
measured
in
the
Kowala
section
parallel
the
δ
13
C
carb
pattern
measured
in
carbonate-rich
sections
(
Fig.
3
and
Fig.
5
)
.
Although
the
carbonate
carbon
isotope
record
suggests
that
organic
carbon
burial
rates
increased
and
implies
that
[
CO
2
]
changed
across
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
,
no
decrease
is
observed
in
ε
p
.
One
could
argue
that
increased
productivity
promoted
the
enhanced
deposition
of
organic
carbon
(
e.g.
Algeo
et
al.
,
1995
,
Murphy
et
al.
,
2000
and
Joachimski
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
If
so
,
we
would
expect
an
associated
increase
in
cellular
growth
rates
and
therefore
reduced
ε
p
values
,
independently
of
a
change
in
global
CO
2
levels
(
Fig.
6
)
.
Since
we
do
not
observe
a
decrease
in
estimated
ε
p
values
,
it
is
clear
that
neither
changes
in
atmospheric
CO
2
or
nutrient
availability
influenced
isotopic
fractionation
.
Perhaps
CO
2
levels
were
high
enough
to
maintain
relatively
high
concentrations
of
intracellular
CO
2
,
despite
any
changes
in
growth
conditions
that
accompanied
the
increase
in
organic
carbon
preservation
.
According
to
the
GeocarbII
model
(
Berner
,
1994
and
Berner
,
1997
)
,
atmospheric
CO
2
concentrations
were
7
–
9
times
higher
in
the
Late
Devonian
(
2100
–
2700
ppm
V
)
than
during
preindustrial
times
.
High
CO
2
concentrations
or
low
μm
/
[
CO
2
]
ratios
are
expected
to
drive
ε
p
to
near
maximum
fractionation
(
ε
f
)
.
The
relationship
between
the
isotopic
fractionation
associated
with
the
production
of
primary
biomass
,
dissolved
CO
2
and
growth
rate
is
depicted
in
Fig.
6
(
based
on
data
reported
for
modern
phytoplankton
;
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
This
graph
clearly
shows
that
ε
p
for
modern
phytoplankton
can
not
exceed
25
‰
and
that
relatively
large
values
for
ε
p
are
observed
either
at
low
growth
rates
or
at
high
p
CO
2
.
Most
important
,
a
decrease
in
[
CO
2
]
will
affect
the
photosynthetic
isotopic
fractionation
to
a
lesser
degree
at
high
p
CO
2
than
at
low
p
CO
2
.
The
photosynthetic
isotopic
fractionation
factor
can
be
calculated
in
case
the
carbon
isotopic
composition
of
dissolved
CO
2
can
be
estimated
.
Since
dissolved
CO
2
is
in
thermodynamic
isotopic
equilibrium
with
bicarbonate
,
δ
13
C
of
CO
2
can
be
calculated
from
δ
13
C
carb
if
the
ambient
water
temperature
is
known
.
However
,
no
reliable
sea
surface
temperature
data
for
Late
Devonian
tropical
seas
are
available
.
Since
the
Late
Devonian
is
generally
considered
as
a
relatively
warm
climatic
period
,
sea
surface
temperatures
for
tropical
Devonian
seas
were
assumed
of
have
been
in
the
range
of
25
–
30
°
C
.
The
isotopic
compositions
of
Late
Frasnian
micrites
and
well-preserved
brachiopod
shells
are
approximately
+1
‰
which
translates
into
an
isotopic
composition
of
dissolved
CO
2
of
−
7.9
to
−
7.3
‰
(
using
the
fractionation
factors
given
by
Romanek
et
al.
,
1992
)
.
If
isoprenoids
are
assumed
to
be
depleted
by
4
‰
relative
to
primary
biomass
(
Bidigare
et
al.
,
1997
)
,
primary
organic
carbon
had
an
isotopic
composition
around
−
29
‰
,
and
ε
p
ranged
from
21.7
to
22.3
‰
[
ε
p
=
1000
(
α
−
1
)
with
α
=
(
1000
+
δ
CO
2
)
/
(
1000
+
δ
biomass
)
]
.
These
values
for
ε
p
are
quite
large
in
comparison
to
photosynthetic
fractionation
factors
documented
in
the
literature
.
For
example
,
ε
p
values
for
the
Cenomanian
–
Turonian
black
shale
event
(
CTBE
)
are
around
20
‰
(
pre
-
and
post-excursion
;
Hayes
et
al.
,
1989
)
and
ε
p
values
smaller
than
20
‰
were
reported
for
the
Mesozoic
(
Popp
et
al.
,
1989
)
and
Cenozoic
(
Pagani
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
However
,
ε
p
calculated
for
the
Late
Frasnian
is
smaller
than
the
maximum
fractionation
expected
for
modern
diatoms
and
haptophytes
(
25
‰
;
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
)
and
seems
not
to
support
the
idea
that
high
CO
2
concentrations
resulted
in
a
maximum
fractionation
.
The
lower
than
expected
photosynthetic
fractionation
could
be
explained
by
a
significant
contribution
of
cyanobacterial
biomass
to
TOC
.
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
and
Sakata
et
al.
,
1998
found
that
ε
p
for
planktonic
cyanobacteria
ranges
from
16
to
22
‰
and
that
ε
f
for
cyanobacteria
is
smaller
than
ε
f
for
eukaryotic
algae
.
Assuming
that
the
fraction
of
cyanobacterial
biomass
on
TOC
was
40
%
,
ε
p
for
phototrophic
cyanobacteria
ranged
from
16
to
22
‰
and
,
ε
f
of
eukaryotic
algae
was
25
‰
,
ε
f
for
total
biomass
would
be
in
the
range
of
21.4
–
23.8
‰
.
If
cyanobacterial
biomass
formed
a
significant
fraction
of
total
biomass
,
the
maximum
fractionation
for
Late
Devonian
total
primary
photosynthate
could
have
been
in
the
range
of
22
–
23
‰
and
in
relatively
good
agreement
with
calculated
values
.
The
measured
isotopic
composition
of
hopanes
,
compounds
derived
exclusively
from
prokaryotic
precursors
,
is
close
to
those
of
coexisting
compounds
derived
from
algae
and
may
point
to
a
contribution
of
cyanobacteria
(
Sakata
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Since
photosynthetic
fractionation
of
selected
modern
cyanobacteria
is
apparently
independent
of
the
concentration
of
dissolved
CO
2
(
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
)
,
a
very
high
proportion
of
cyanobacteria
among
the
primary
producers
could
explain
our
observation
that
ε
p
does
not
change
with
an
inferred
lowering
of
p
CO
2
.
Cyanobacteria
,
although
present
,
were
most
probably
not
the
only
photoautotrophs
,
and
we
argue
that
high
CO
2
levels
are
a
more
likely
explanation
for
the
constant
ε
p
values
.
It
should
be
noted
that
in
addition
to
concentrations
of
CO
2
,
phytoplankton
growth
rate
(
μm
)
and
cell
geometry
are
important
influences
on
ε
p
(
Laws
et
al.
,
1995
,
Popp
et
al.
,
1998
and
Pancost
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
However
,
the
isotopic
consequences
of
variations
in
growth
rate
,
cell
geometry
as
well
as
variations
between
algae
taxonomic
groups
are
minimized
at
elevated
p
CO
2
and
rendered
insignificant
at
atmospheric
concentrations
exceeding
8
–
10
times
preindustrial
levels
(
Patzkowsky
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Thus
,
large
ε
p
values
and
the
lack
of
an
ε
p
decrease
coincident
with
the
inferred
p
CO
2
drawdown
are
consistent
with
our
current
understanding
of
carbon
isotope
fractionation
by
marine
algae
and
are
also
consistent
with
previously
estimated
Upper
Devonian
CO
2
concentrations
.
In
contrast
,
in
a
study
on
the
Cretaceous
Greenhorn
Formation
,
Hayes
et
al.
(
1989
)
showed
that
δ
13
C
of
individual
organic
compounds
,
TOC
and
carbonate
exhibit
differing
isotopic
shifts
across
the
CTBE
.
The
larger
δ
13
C
shift
of
investigated
porphyrins
and
isoprenoids
relative
to
δ
13
C
carb
was
related
to
a
1.5
‰
decrease
in
ε
p
during
the
CTBE
isotopic
excursion
(
Hayes
et
al.
,
1989
)
.
Kuypers
et
al.
(
1998
)
observed
a
+2.5
to
+4.5
‰
larger
excursion
in
algal-derived
steranes
and
bacterial
hopanes
in
comparison
to
inorganic
δ
13
C.
Hayes
et
al.
(
1989
)
as
well
as
Kuypers
et
al.
(
1998
)
interpreted
the
decrease
in
ε
p
as
a
consequence
of
a
decline
in
the
concentration
of
dissolved
CO
2
due
to
the
burial
of
organic
carbon
.
The
Cenomanian
–
Turonian
as
well
as
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
black
shale
events
reflect
joint
characteristics
.
A
greenhouse
climate
,
a
eustatic
sea-level
highstand
,
superimposed
short-term
transgressive
–
regressive
pulses
,
the
deposition
of
organic
carbon-rich
sediments
and
positive
δ
13
C
carb
excursions
are
observed
for
both
time
periods
.
Mass
extinction
events
are
manifested
for
both
boundaries
and
climatic
cooling
was
discussed
as
a
consequence
of
the
enhanced
organic
carbon
burial
(
e.g.
Jenkyns
et
al.
,
1994
,
Clarke
and
Jenkyns
,
1999
and
Joachimski
and
Buggisch
,
1993
)
.
However
,
although
a
decrease
in
ε
p
has
been
deduced
for
the
Cenomanian
–
Turonian
anoxic
event
,
ε
p
does
not
change
during
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
isotopic
excursion
.
CO
2
concentrations
during
the
Cenomanian
–
Turonian
were
modeled
to
be
2
–
4
times
higher
than
during
preindustrial
times
(
Berner
,
1994
)
.
With
these
CO
2
concentrations
,
any
variation
in
the
oceanic
dissolved
CO
2
content
is
expected
to
result
in
a
change
in
ε
p
.
However
,
Upper
Devonian
CO
2
concentrations
were
modeled
to
be
7
–
9
times
higher
than
during
preindustrial
times
(
Berner
,
1997
)
.
Given
these
high
atmospheric
and
oceanic
dissolved
CO
2
contents
,
any
superimposed
change
in
p
CO
2
is
not
expected
to
significantly
affect
fractionation
during
photosynthetic
carbon
assimilation
.

Conclusions
The
compilation
of
carbon
isotope
records
measured
across
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
boundary
interval
shows
two
positive
excursions
in
δ
13
C
carb
during
the
Late
Frasnian
and
Early
Famennian
.
The
increase
in
the
inorganic
carbon
isotope
signals
can
be
correlated
with
the
deposition
of
the
Kellwasser
horizons
.
The
isotopic
records
of
TOC
and
individual
organic
compounds
parallel
the
carbonate
δ
13
C
carb
record
and
do
not
show
any
evidence
for
negative
carbon
isotope
shift
associated
with
the
Upper
Devonian
mass
extinction
event
.
The
positive
excursions
in
δ
13
C
carb
are
interpreted
as
the
consequence
of
an
increase
in
the
organic
carbon
burial
fraction
on
total
carbon
burial
.
The
latter
is
expected
to
result
in
a
decrease
in
atmospheric
p
CO
2
levels
and
to
culminate
in
global
climatic
cooling
.
However
,
we
do
not
observe
a
change
in
the
photosynthetic
fractionation
factor
ε
p
that
might
be
expected
as
a
consequence
of
the
increased
organic
carbon
burial
rate
and
concomitant
decrease
in
[
CO
2
]
.
Photosynthetic
fractionation
is
interpreted
to
be
at
near
maximum
values
probably
due
to
high
Devonian
atmospheric
and
oceanic
dissolved
CO
2
levels
.
At
high
p
CO
2
any
superimposed
change
in
[
CO
2
]
will
not
result
in
a
significant
change
in
the
photosynthetic
fractionation
and
the
shift
in
δ
13
C
values
for
individual
organic
compounds
is
expected
to
equal
the
shift
recorded
in
δ
13
C
carb
.
As
a
consequence
,
the
use
of
carbon
isotopes
and
estimates
of
ε
p
did
not
help
to
constrain
expected
changes
in
Late
Devonian
p
CO
2
levels
.
Nevertheless
,
we
argue
that
climatic
cooling
as
a
consequence
of
enhanced
organic
carbon
burial
may
represent
a
potential
mechanism
to
account
for
the
Late
Devonian
mass
extinction
.
Paleontological
investigations
clearly
show
that
low-latitude
ecosystems
were
severely
decimated
.
Faunal
groups
living
in
deeper
waters
or
higher
latitudes
were
almost
not
affected
and
were
migrating
into
low
latitudes
after
the
mass
extinction
(
Becker
,
1979
,
McGhee
,
1982
,
Kalvoda
,
1986
,
Stearn
,
1987
,
Lethiers
and
Raymond
,
1991
,
Copper
,
1986
and
Copper
,
1998
)
.
To
our
understanding
,
this
pattern
could
be
explained
by
climatic
cooling
affecting
especially
faunal
groups
adapted
to
warm
tropical
temperatures
.
However
,
this
hypothesis
awaits
confirmation
from
high-resolution
δ
18
O
records
that
may
give
evidence
for
prominent
variations
in
tropical
sea
surface
temperature
during
the
Frasnian
–
Famennian
transition
