between
metamorphism
and

in
proterozoic
rocks
of

Lunavada
region
,
Southern
Aravalli
Mountain
Belt
(
India
)
—
a
microstructural
study
Abstract
The
southern
margin
of
the
Aravalli
Mountain
Belt
(
AMB
)
is
known
to
have
undergone
polyphase
deformation
during
the
Mesoproterozoic
.
The
Lunavada
Group
of
rocks
,
which
is
an
important
constituent
of
the
southern
parts
of
AMB
,
reveals
three
episodes
of
deformation
;
D
1
,
D
2
and
D
3
.
In
this
paper
,
interpretations
based
on
petrographic
studies
of
schists
and
quartzites
of
the
region
are
presented
and
the
relationship
between
metamorphic
and
deformational
events
is
discussed
.
It
is
established
that
from
north
to
south
,
there
is
a
marked
zonation
from
chlorite
to
garnet
–
biotite
schists
.
Metamorphism
(
M
1
)
accompanied
D
1
and
was
progressive
.
M
2-1
metamorphism
associated
with
major
part
of
D
2
was
also
progressive
.
However
,
M
2-2
that
synchronized
with
the
waning
phases
of
D
2
and
early-D
3
deformation
was
retrogressive
.
Porphyroblast
–
matrix
relationships
in
the
garnet
–
biotite
schists
of
the
region
have
been
useful
in
establishing
these
facts
.
The
metamorphic
rocks
studied
were
intruded
by
Godhra
Granite
during
the
late-D
3
/
post-D
3
event
.
The
heat
supplied
by
this
granite
resulted
in
static
recrystallization
and
formation
of
annealing
microstructures
in
rocks
close
to
the
granite
.
It
is
established
that
Grain
Boundary
Migration
Recrystallization
associated
with
dislocation
creep
and
Grain
Boundary
Area
Reduction
were
the
two
deformation
mechanisms
dominant
in
rocks
lying
far
and
close
from
the
Godhra
Granite
,
respectively
.

Introduction
The
Southern
Aravalli
Mountain
Belt
(
SAMB
)
forms
the
southernmost
tip
of
the
Aravalli
Mountain
Belt
(
AMB
)
which
is
a
major
Proterozoic
orogenic
belt
in
northwestern
India
(
Fig.
1
)
.
The
SAMB
occupies
an
area
of
more
than
30,000
km
2
extending
from
southern
parts
of
Rajasthan
into
northeastern
Gujarat
and
comprises
metasedimentary
and
granitic
rocks
.
The
metasediments
belong
to
the
Lunavada
and
Champaner
Groups
of
the
Aravalli
Supergroup
(
Gupta
et
al.
,
1992
and
Gupta
et
al.
,
1995
)
.
Mamtani
et
al.
,
1998
,
Mamtani
and
Karanth
,
1996a
and
Mamtani
et
al.
,
2000
have
worked
out
the
structural
geology
of
the
area
around
Lunavada
.
In
the
present
paper
,
various
microstructures
observed
in
schists
and
quartzites
of
the
Lunavada
region
are
described
.
These
microstructures
have
been
used
to
understand
microscale
deformation
mechanisms
.
Moreover
,
a
correlation
is
established
between
metamorphic
and
deformation
events
on
the
basis
of
Porphyroblast
–
matrix
relationships
preserved
in
garnet
–
biotite
schists
of
the
region
.

.
Geological
setting
and
structural
geology
The
Proterozoic
rocks
of
the
Lunavada
region
,
Panchmahals
district
,
Gujarat
are
assigned
to
the
Lunavada
Group
which
is
the
second
youngest
group
of
the
Aravalli
Supergroup
(
Gupta
et
al.
,
1980
,
Gupta
et
al.
,
1992
and
Gupta
et
al.
,
1995
)
.
The
Lunavada
Group
comprises
phyllite
,
mica
schist
,
calc-silicate
,
quartz
–
chlorite
schist
,
meta-subgreywacke
,
meta-siltstone
,
meta-semipelite
,
meta-protoquartzite
with
minor
layers
and
thin
sheets
of
dolomitic
marble
,
petromict
meta-conglomerate
,
manganiferous
phyllite
and
phosphatic
algal
meta-dolomite
(
Gupta
et
al.
,
1980
,
Gupta
et
al.
,
1992
and
Gupta
et
al.
,
1995
)
.
It
occupies
an
area
of
10,000
km
2
in
the
SAMB
and
is
flanked
in
the
northeast
and
northwest
by
the
Udaipur
and
Jharol
Groups
of
the
Aravalli
Supergroup
(
Fig.
2
)
.
To
its
west
and
south
lie
the
Godhra
granite
and
gneisses
.
The
Godhra
granite
has
been
dated
as
955
±
20
Ma
by
Rb/Sr
method
(
Gopalan
et
al.
,
1979
)
.
These
granitic
rocks
have
an
intrusive
relationship
with
the
surrounding
metasedimentary
rocks
.
The
rocks
of
the
southernmost
part
of
SAMB
belong
to
the
Champaner
Group
which
comprises
of
low
grade
phyllites
and
quartzites
.
The
present
investigation
was
carried
out
around
the
towns
of
Lunavada
,
Santrampur
and
Kadana
where
the
rocks
encountered
are
quartzites
alternating
with
schists
along
with
some
calc-silicate
bands
.
The
quartzites
form
long
ridges
whilst
the
schistose
rocks
occur
in
the
low-lying
areas
.
According
to
Iqbaluddin
(
1989
)
,
the
quartzite
–
schist
layers
belong
to
the
Kadana
Formation
of
the
Lunavada
Group
.
Field
and
satellite
imagery
studies
have
shown
that
the
quartzite
ridges
have
a
complex
regional
scale
outcrop
pattern
which
is
characteristic
of
a
history
involving
polyphase
folding
(
Fig.
3
)
.
The
northern
part
of
the
study
area
shows
tight
D
2
folds
,
closely
spaced
axial
plane
fractures
and
joints
.
Shearing
is
observed
to
have
occurred
along
these
axial
plane
fractures
during
D
3
deformation
(
Mamtani
et
al.
,
1999a
)
.
The
southern
part
of
the
study
area
(
around
Lunavada
,
Santrampur
and
further
south
in
Fig.
3
)
is
characterized
by
regional
scale
folds
.
Mamtani
,
1998
,
Mamtani
et
al.
,
1998
,
Mamtani
et
al.
,
1999a
and
Mamtani
et
al.
,
1999b
have
worked
out
the
structural
history
of
the
region
which
is
summarized
below
:
1
.
The
Proterozoic
rocks
of
the
Lunavada
region
have
undergone
three
episodes
of
deformation
,
viz
.
D
1
,
D
2
and
D
3
.
2
.
The
first
two
deformational
events
were
coaxial
and
resulted
in
NE
–
SW
trending
folds
.
3
.
The
third
episode
of
deformation
resulted
in
open
folds
with
trends
varying
between
E
–
W
and
NW
–
SE
.
4
.
Except
for
the
presence
of
a
few
D
3
kinks
and
minor
fold
axis
,
there
is
no
other
mesoscopic
evidence
of
D
3
folding
.
D
3
folds
have
developed
on
km-scale
limbs
of
the
D
1
–
D
2
folds
.
5
.
The
superposition
of
the
three
folds
in
various
combinations
has
resulted
in
the
development
of
different
types
of
large
scale
interference
patterns
.
Type-III
interference
pattern
(
Ramsay
and
Huber
,
1987
)
has
developed
on
account
of
superposition
of
D
1
and
D
2
folds
while
Type-I
interference
pattern
has
developed
due
to
superposition
of
D
3
on
D
1
–
D
2
folds
.
6
.
The
degree
of
overturning
of
D
2
folds
increases
from
north
to
south
.
The
folds
are
upright
in
the
northernmost
part
of
the
area
(
around
Ditwas
)
.
In
the
south
,
they
get
overturned
with
a
southeasterly
vergence
.

Microstructures
and
mechanisms
of
deformation
Petrographic
study
of
schists
from
the
study
area
has
revealed
that
the
regional
metamorphism
progressed
up
to
lower
amphibolite
facies
.
This
has
resulted
in
the
development
of
porphyroblasts
of
garnet
and
biotite
.
From
north
to
south
,
a
zonation
from
chlorite
to
garnet
–
biotite
schist
through
biotite
schist
is
recorded
(
Fig.
3
)
.
In
this
section
,
the
various
microstructures
observed
in
quartzites
and
different
types
of
schists
are
described
and
have
been
used
to
decipher
deformational
mechanisms
.
3.1
.
Discrete
crenulation
cleavage
This
has
developed
in
chlorite
schists
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
study
area
.
In
these
rocks
,
three
planar
surfaces
are
recognizable
,
viz
.
S
0
(
bedding
plane
)
,
S
1
(
first
schistosity
)
and
S
2
(
discrete
crenulation
cleavage
)
(
Figs.
4
(
a
)
–
(
c
)
)
.
The
rocks
have
preserved
primary
lithological
layering
(
S
0
)
which
is
marked
by
alternating
layers
of
quartz-rich
and
phyllosilicate
rich
layers
.
The
first
schistosity
(
S
1
)
is
sub-parallel
to
S
0
and
comprises
of
chlorite
,
quartz
and
muscovite
crystals
aligned
parallel
to
one
another
.
The
second
schistosity
is
the
discrete
crenulation
cleavage
(
S
2
)
which
was
formed
on
account
of
crenulation
of
S
1
foliation
during
D
2
.
The
S
2
has
developed
almost
perpendicular
or
at
high
angles
to
the
S
1
and
is
observed
to
have
formed
only
in
the
phyllosilicate
rich
layers
.
There
is
evidence
of
displacement
along
the
S
2
surface
(
Fig.
4
(
c
)
)
.
Similar
evidence
has
been
linked
by
Gray
(
1979
)
to
pressure
solution
.
However
,
at
the
present
scale
of
observation
,
no
significant
evidence
of
recrystallized
quartz
aggregates
and
no
metamorphic
differentiation
in
the
vicinity
of
the
discrete
crenulation
cleavages
along
which
the
occurred
displacement
has
been
observed
.
Moreover
,
Fig.
4
(
b
)
shows
some
microscale
dragging
along
the
cleavages
.
Therefore
the
possibility
of
these
discrete
crenulation
cleavages
being
planes
of
shear
can
not
be
totally
ruled
out
.
3.2
.
Differentiated
crenulation
cleavage
This
has
developed
in
the
higher
grade
schists
of
the
region
and
is
particularly
well
developed
in
the
garnet
–
biotite
schists
to
the
south
of
Lunavada
and
Santrampur
.
It
is
made
up
of
alternating
quartz
(
Q
)
and
mica
(
M
)
domains
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Two
schistosities
(
S
1
and
S
2
)
are
prominent
microscopically
.
S
1
is
made
up
of
chlorite
,
muscovite
and
biotite
crystals
while
new
generation
biotite
and
muscovite
flakes
are
developed
parallel
to
S
2
.
The
M-domains
vary
in
thickness
from
0.1
to
0.5
mm
.
A
few
of
these
zones
also
preserve
a
shear
band
cleavage
that
lies
at
a
low
angle
(
<
45
°
)
to
the
domain
boundary
between
M
and
Q
domains
(
Mamtani
and
Karanth
,
1996a
and
Mamtani
and
Karanth
,
1996b
)
.
All
these
microstructures
in
the
cleavage
zones
have
been
used
to
interpret
the
mechanisms
of
deformation
during
origin
of
crenulation
cleavages
(
Mamtani
et
al.
,
1999b
)
.
Accordingly
it
has
been
argued
that
pressure
solution
is
an
important
deformational
mechanism
during
the
early
stages
of
crenulation
and
this
imparts
the
domainal
fabric
to
the
rock
.
However
,
intracrystalline
crystal
plastic
deformation
becomes
dominant
during
the
later
stages
which
results
in
the
development
of
shear
structures
in
cleavage
zones
.
3.3
.
Millipede
microstructure
This
microstructure
is
characterized
by
oppositely
concave
microfolds
(
OCMs
)
and
usually
occurs
as
inclusion
trails
(
S
i
=
internal
foliation
)
within
porphyroblasts
in
schists
(
Bell
and
Rubenach
,
1980
)
.
Millipede
microstructure
is
preserved
in
some
biotite
porphyroblasts
in
garnet
–
biotite
schists
of
the
study
area
(
Figs.
6
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
)
.
It
is
defined
by
oppositely
curving
quartz
inclusion
trails
(
S
1
)
within
the
biotite
porphyroblast
.
S
1
is
relatively
straight
in
the
core
of
the
biotite
and
gradually
curves
towards
the
rims
and
continues
to
merge
into
the
external
schistosity
(
S
2
)
.
Similar
structures
are
known
to
develop
around
rotating
rigid
objects
at
low
strains
in
laboratory
experiments
(
Ghosh
,
1975
,
Ghosh
,
1977
and
Ghosh
and
Ramberg
,
1976
)
.
Johnson
and
Moore
,
1996
and
Johnson
and
Bell
,
1996
have
stated
that
the
presence
of
millipedes
indicates
a
state
of
low
strain
during
their
genesis
.
Since
the
microfolds
that
make
up
the
millipedes
within
the
biotite
are
open
compared
with
those
in
the
matrix
,
the
biotite
porphyroblast
is
interpreted
to
have
grown
under
a
low
strain
state
during
D
2
.
3.4
.
Textures
in
quartzites
Thin
sections
prepared
from
different
localities
of
the
area
show
that
the
quartzites
comprise
of
two
textural
varieties
based
on
grain
boundaries
—
either
the
grain
boundaries
are
irregular
or
they
are
straight
.
The
irregular
grain
boundaries
(
Fig.
7
(
a
)
)
are
prevalent
dominantly
in
the
quartzite
occurrences
that
are
distant
from
the
Godhra
Granite
.
According
to
Urai
et
al.
,
1986
and
Passchier
and
Trouw
,
1996
,
the
presence
of
irregular
grain
boundaries
indicates
intracrystalline
deformation
as
the
rock
underwent
dynamic
recrystallization
by
Grain
Boundary
Migration
(
GBM
)
.
Some
of
the
quartz
crystals
show
subgrains
(
Fig.
7
(
b
)
)
,
a
textural
feature
pointing
to
recovery
during
dynamic
recrystallization
.
This
also
indicates
that
during
deformation
,
recrystallization-accommodated
dislocation
creep
was
important
(
Nicolas
and
Poirier
,
1976
,
Tullis
and
Yund
,
1985
,
Tullis
et
al.
,
1990
and
Passchier
and
Trouw
,
1996
)
.
Dislocation
creep
has
been
recognized
as
an
important
deformation
mechanism
for
quartz
aggregates
under
conditions
of
greenschist
facies
or
higher
(
White
,
1976
,
Mitra
,
1978
and
Hirth
and
Tullis
,
1992
)
.
Thin
sections
of
quartzites
occurring
closer
to
the
margin
of
the
Godhra
Granite
show
a
granoblastic
texture
characterized
by
straight
to
smoothly
curved
grain
boundaries
,
120
°
triple
points
and
sharp
extinction
(
Fig.
7
(
c
)
)
.
These
microstructural
characteristics
clearly
point
to
static
recrystallization
with
Grain
Boundary
Area
Reduction
(
GBAR
)
as
the
principal
mechanism
(
Passchier
and
Trouw
,
1996
)
.
The
presence
of
120
°
triple
points
,
referred
to
as
foam
microstructure
by
Vernon
(
1976
)
,
is
indicative
of
heat
outlasting
deformation
or
annealing
.
Bons
and
Urai
,
1992
and
Passchier
and
Trouw
,
1996
have
stated
that
GBAR
is
especially
pronounced
at
high
temperatures
after
deformation
ceases
,
i.e.
,
in
a
static
environment
.
In
the
present
case
,
the
high
temperature
for
static
recrystallization
was
supplied
by
the
Godhra
Granite
that
intruded
the
region
.
Fig.
7
(
a
)
and
(
c
)
are
photomicrographs
(
taken
at
same
magnification
)
of
quartzites
occurring
far
and
close
to
the
granite
margin
.
It
is
quite
clear
that
the
former
has
finer
crystals
while
the
latter
has
coarser
crystals
.
This
indicates
that
the
heat
supplied
by
the
granite
played
an
important
role
in
microstructure
development
of
the
latter
.
Further
corroboration
of
this
fact
has
also
come
from
Crystal
Size
Distribution
(
CSD
)
study
of
quartz
crystals
in
schists
and
quartzites
.
Moreover
,
post-deformational
changes
in
microstructure
are
known
to
occur
at
the
end
of
an
orogeny
when
deformation
has
essentially
ceased
and
the
rocks
are
at
high
temperatures
(
>
300
°
C
)
or
when
deformed
rocks
are
subjected
to
sustained
heating
from
post-tectonic
plutons
(
Knipe
,
1989
)
and
also
in
laboratory
experiments
with
octachloropropane
(
Ree
and
Park
,
1997
)
.
It
is
envisaged
that
prior
to
the
intrusion
of
granite
,
the
quartz
crystals
were
in
a
higher
strain
condition
characterized
by
irregular
grain
boundaries
.
Such
a
microstructure
is
thermodynamically
unstable
and
would
have
a
tendency
to
proceed
to
a
lower
energy
state
.
The
late
to
post
deformational
granitic
intrusion
provided
the
necessary
heat
energy
required
for
release
of
internal
strain
and
achievement
of
a
thermodynamically
stable
microstructure
.
As
a
result
,
a
stable
granoblastic
microstructure
developed
which
is
more
pronounced
in
the
rocks
close
to
the
granite
margin
.
It
can
be
argued
that
a
granoblastic
fabric
can
also
form
syntectonically
by
dynamic
recrystallization
(
Means
and
Ree
,
1988
)
or
in
high
grade
gneisses
(
Passchier
et
al.
,
1990
)
.
However
,
in
the
present
study
,
it
is
clearly
seen
that
the
quartzites
close
to
the
granite
show
a
granoblastic
texture
,
sharp
extinction
and
coarser
grain
size
.
Quartzites
farther
from
the
granite
show
irregular
grain
boundaries
,
sub-grains
,
a
finer
grain
size
and
absence
of
a
granoblastic
texture
.
It
is
therefore
logical
to
assume
that
the
microstructures
in
quartzites
close
to
the
granite
are
a
result
of
static
recrystallization
by
GBAR
related
to
heat
supplied
by
the
granite
.
This
is
in
accordance
with
Bons
and
Urai
,
1992
and
Passchier
and
Trouw
,
1996
who
have
suggested
that
GBAR
is
pronounced
only
after
the
deformation
ceases
.

Porphyroblast
–
matrix
relationships
The
mica
schists
around
Lunavada
and
Santrampur
are
characterized
by
foliations
of
different
generations
and
porphyroblastic
minerals
such
as
garnet
and
biotite
which
contain
foliations
as
quartz
inclusion
trails
.
The
relationship
between
the
internal
foliation
(
S
i
)
within
the
porphyroblasts
and
the
matrix
foliation
(
S
e
)
outside
the
porphyroblast
was
used
to
determine
the
relative
timing
of
growth
of
minerals
with
reference
to
foliation
of
a
particular
generation
.
This
is
in
accordance
with
the
criteria
described
by
Zwart
,
1962
,
Spry
,
1969
,
Vernon
,
1976
,
Ghosh
,
1993
and
Passchier
and
Trouw
,
1996
.
Most
of
the
garnet
and
biotite
porphyroblasts
preserving
the
microfolded
or
sigmoidal
inclusion
trails
are
identified
as
syntectonic
with
D
2
deformation
(
Figs.
8
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
;
also
Fig.
6
)
.
The
intensity/tightness
of
folding
of
the
inclusions
with
respect
to
those
in
the
matrix
has
been
further
useful
in
classifying
the
porphyroblasts
as
early-D
2
or
late-D
2
.
Fig.
8
(
a
)
shows
a
porphyroblast
of
biotite
with
quartz
inclusion
trails
(
S
i
=
S
1
)
which
show
open
microfolds
.
In
contrast
,
the
microfolds
outside
the
porphyroblast
are
tightly
crenulated
.
This
indicates
that
the
biotite
porphyroblast
grew
during
the
early
stages
of
D
2
deformation
.
A
few
porphyroblasts
preserve
relatively
tight
S
1
crenulations
and
also
include
the
S
2
foliation
at
the
rims
(
Fig.
8
(
b
)
)
.
Such
pophyroblasts
are
classified
as
late-D
2
.
Some
garnet
porphyroblasts
preserve
sigmoidal
S
1
inclusion
trails
of
quartz
and
feldspar
which
gradually
curve
into
S
2
while
the
cleavage
domain
outside
the
porphyroblast
has
a
single
homogenized
foliation
S
2
(
Fig.
8
(
c
)
)
.
It
is
envisaged
that
the
sigmoidally
curving
S
1
schistosity
along
with
S
2
was
included
in
the
garnet
porphyroblast
during
earlier
stages
of
D
2
.
With
continuing
deformation
,
the
matrix
foliation
further
deformed
and
rotated
into
parallelism
with
the
S
2
while
the
sigmoidal
relation
between
S
1
and
S
2
within
the
porphyroblast
remained
frozen
in
the
same
stage
at
which
it
was
included
,
thus
remaining
unaffected
by
later
deformation
(
Mamtani
and
Karanth
,
1997
)
.
Such
porphyroblasts
of
garnet
are
also
classified
as
syn-D
2
.

Thermal
metamorphism
Regional
metamorphism
in
the
Lunavada
–
Santrampur
region
was
followed
by
thermal
metamorphism
related
to
the
intrusion
of
the
Godhra
Granite
.
The
effects
of
heat
supplied
by
the
Godhra
granite
are
significant
in
the
southwestern
part
of
the
study
area
,
i.e.
,
to
the
south
of
Lunavada
.
Since
the
granite
does
not
lie
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
study
area
,
common
high-temperature
metamorphic
minerals
like
andalusite
and
sillimanite
are
not
observed
.
Nevertheless
,
the
effect
of
the
thermal
event
is
quite
obvious
from
the
CSD
studies
on
rocks
of
the
region
.
The
method
of
measuring
CSDs
using
thin
sections
of
rocks
has
been
described
by
Marsh
,
1988
and
Mamtani
and
Karanth
,
1996b
.
CSD
studies
provide
statistical
data
for
crystals
(
of
a
particular
mineral
)
of
different
sizes
within
a
unit
area
of
a
thin
section
.
Based
on
this
data
,
CSD
plots
such
as
size
(
L
mm
)
vs.
normal
log
of
population
density
[
l
n
(
n
)
]
can
be
prepared
.
The
shape
of
a
CSD
plot
represents
the
extent
to
which
a
rock
underwent
annealing
.
In
the
present
investigation
,
CSD
of
quartz
crystals
were
calculated
in
thin
sections
of
three
schist
and
four
quartzite
samples
collected
at
varying
distance
from
the
boundary
of
the
Godhra
Granite
.
Fig.
2
shows
the
location
of
the
schist
and
quartzite
samples
.
Figs.
9
(
a
)
and
9
(
b
)
are
CSD
plots
for
schist
and
quartzite
samples
,
respectively
.
Both
rock
types
indicate
that
,
in
comparison
with
samples
away
from
the
Godhra
Granite
boundary
,
samples
close
to
the
granite
possess
(
i
)
quartz
crystals
which
have
crystallized
over
a
wider
size
range
,
(
ii
)
CSD
plots
with
a
lower
slope
,
and
(
iii
)
fewer
quartz
crystals
within
a
unit
area
.
Moreover
,
the
CSD
plots
for
schists
lying
close
to
the
granite
have
a
bell
shape
(
A
and
B
in
Fig.
9
(
a
)
)
while
the
plot
for
sample
away
from
the
granite
is
near
linear
(
C
in
Fig.
9
(
a
)
)
.
This
indicates
that
all
the
rocks
initially
underwent
continuous
nucleation
and
growth
.
Subsequently
,
rocks
closer
to
the
granite
underwent
annealing
such
that
smaller
crystals
were
resorped
at
the
expense
of
larger
crystals
(
see
Cashman
and
Ferry
,
1988
,
Cashman
and
Marsh
,
1988
and
Mamtani
and
Karanth
,
1996b
for
details
of
CSD
plot
interpretations
)
.
The
heat
for
annealing
was
supplied
by
intrusion
of
the
Godhra
Granite
.

Discussion
On
the
basis
of
the
present
petrographic
study
,
the
time
relationship
between
deformation
and
metamorphism
can
be
established
.
The
metamorphic
history
of
chlorite
schists
occurring
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
study
area
is
rather
simple
.
As
mentioned
earlier
,
these
rocks
show
three
prominent
planar
surfaces
(
S
0
,
S
1
and
S
2
)
.
S
1
and
S
2
developed
during
D
1
and
D
2
respectively
.
Chlorite
and
muscovite
crystals
formed
during
D
1
.
These
underwent
rotation
along
S
2
and
some
recrystallization
during
D
2
.
No
evidence
of
growth
of
new
minerals
cutting
across
D
2
is
observed
in
the
chlorite
schists
,
thus
implying
that
D
3
was
generally
devoid
of
any
metamorphism
.
The
chlorite
schists
therefore
only
record
a
single
metamorphic
event
.
The
paragenesis
observed
is
chlorite
+
muscovite
+
quartz
which
is
typical
of
a
chlorite
zone
within
the
greenschist
facies
(
Yardley
,
1989
and
Spear
,
1993
)
.
The
garnet
–
biotite
schists
of
the
region
are
most
important
in
determining
the
various
metamorphic
events
that
accompanied
different
deformation
episodes
.
These
possess
differentiated
crenulation
cleavage
characterized
by
alternating
Q
and
M
domains
.
Garnet
,
biotite
,
chlorite
,
muscovite
and
quartz
are
the
major
minerals
present
.
Chlorite
and
biotite
crystals
occur
along
foliations
of
different
generations
and
are
accordingly
classified
.
Chlorite
(
1
)
and
biotite
(
1
)
occur
along
the
S
1
schistosity
and
are
syn-D
1
.
The
metamorphic
event
which
accompanied
D
1
is
referred
to
as
M
1
.
Biotite
(
2
)
crystals
,
which
occur
with
their
(
001
)
planes
parallel
to
S
2
,
have
grown
during
D
2
deformation
.
Biotite
(
2
)
porphyroblasts
with
spiral
(
helictic
)
inclusion
trails
of
quartz
(
e.g.
,
Fig.
8
(
a
)
and
(
b
)
)
are
also
syn-D
2
.
Similarly
the
garnet
porphyroblasts
with
sigmoidal
inclusion
trails
of
quartz
(
e.g.
,
Fig.
8
(
d
)
)
are
also
syn-D
2
.
The
metamorphic
event
which
accompanied
a
major
part
of
D
2
deformation
is
referred
to
as
M
2-1
.
This
was
a
progressive
metamorphic
event
during
which
biotite
(
2
)
crystals
grew
along
S
2
.
That
these
progressive
events
(
M
1
and
M
2-1
)
were
followed
by
retrogressive
metamorphism
(
M
2-2
)
during
the
waning
phases
of
D
2
/
early
D
3
is
evident
by
the
presence
of
(
a
)
chlorite
(
2
)
crystals
that
overgrow
S
2
foliation
,
(
b
)
chlorite
around
syn-D
2
garnet
and
(
c
)
chlorite
along
fractures
in
garnet
that
penetrate
from
core
to
the
rim
.
The
last
metamorphic
event
to
affect
the
rocks
was
a
late-D
3
/
post-D
3
thermal
metamorphism
.
In
rocks
that
lie
close
to
the
granite
,
this
event
resulted
in
annealing
,
coarser
crystals
and
the
development
of
granoblastic
microstructure
in
quartzites
.
It
is
concluded
that
the
thermal
event
led
to
static
recrystallization
of
quartz
on
the
microscale
due
to
the
heat
supplied
by
intrusion
of
the
Godhra
Granite
.
Emplacement
of
the
granite
may
have
been
initiated
during
the
waning
phases
of
D
3
.
However
,
the
field
evidence
for
granite
and
related
pegmatites
intruding
the
foliation
in
schists
indicates
that
the
intrusion
continued
even
after
D
3
.
This
further
supports
the
interpretation
that
the
development
of
granoblastic
texture
,
annealing
and
grain
growth
in
quartzite
occurred
due
to
static
recrystallization
on
the
microscale
.
It
is
also
observed
that
muscovite
crystals
in
garnet
–
biotite
schists
lying
close
to
the
granite
are
large
and
free
from
the
effects
of
intracrystalline
deformation
such
as
undulose
extinction
.
This
indicates
that
the
thermal
event
also
resulted
in
recrystallization
and
grain
growth
of
muscovite
.

Conclusions
The
present
study
has
provided
considerable
insight
into
the
metamorphic
history
and
deformation
mechanisms
of
the
Proterozoic
rocks
around
Lunavada
,
SAMB
(
India
)
.
The
following
conclusions
are
evident
:
1
.
The
rocks
of
the
Lunavada
region
have
undergone
metamorphism
up
to
lower
amphibolite
facies
.
There
is
a
progression
from
chlorite
grade
in
the
northern
parts
to
garnet
grade
in
the
southern
parts
.
2
.
Progressive
regional
metamorphism
M
1
and
M
2-1
accompanied
D
1
and
a
major
part
of
D
2
respectively
.
M
2-2
was
a
retrogressive
event
that
accompanied
the
waning
stages
of
D
2
or
early
D
3
deformation
.
3
.
A
thermal
event
related
to
late-D3
/
post
D
3
Godhra
Granite
intrusion
followed
regional
metamorphism
.
This
led
to
static
recrystallization
on
the
microscale
and
grain
growth
in
rocks
close
to
the
granite
.
4
.
GBM
associated
with
dislocation
creep
is
suggested
to
have
been
an
important
deformation
mechanism
in
quartzites
lying
far
from
the
granite
margin
.
5
.
Annealing
by
GBAR
has
been
discerned
in
quartzites
close
to
the
granite
.
