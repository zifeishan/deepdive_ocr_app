Abstract
Coral
reefs
constitute
real
oasis
sheltering
for
about
one
third
of
the
identified
fishes,
representing
a
major
advantage
for
the
economy
and
tourism
of
many
tropical
countries.
Hov,ever
it
is
paradoxical
to
notice
that
their
formation
at
the
cellular
level
or
even
at
the
scale
of
the
organism
is
still
poorly
knov,n.
Effectively,
biomineralisation,
the
proces~
that
is
at
the
ha~i~
of
their
edification,
is
alv,ays
the
subject
of
numerou~
re~earche~.
Tv,o
combined
mechanism~
lead
to
the
formation
of
a
biomineral,
the
synthesis/secretion
of
macromolecules
referred
to
as
'organic
matrix',
and
the
tran~port
of
ions
fcafcium(
bicarbonates
and
protons
in
the
case
of
calcification)
to
the
mineralising
site.
This

~how~
a
view
of
the

out
on
biominerali-
~ation
in
scleractinian
corals,
including
some

Introduction
"The
organic
forces
separate
the
atoms
of
carbonate
of
lime,
one
by
one,
from
the
foaming
breakers,
and
unite
them
into
a
symmetrical
structure.
Let
the
hurri-
tear
up
its
thousand
huge
fragments:
yet
what
will
that
tell
against
the
accumulated
labour
of
myriads
of
architects
at
work
night
and
day,
month
after
month.
Thus
do
we
see
the
soft
and
gelatinous
body
of
poly-
through
the
agency
of
the
vital
laws,
conquering
the
great
mechanical
power
of
the
waves
of
an
ocean,
which
neither
the
art
of
man
nor
the
inanimate
works
of
nature
could
successfully
resist."
Charles
Darwin,
in:
Journal
of
researches
into
the
natural
lu.story
and
geology
of
the
countries
visited
during
the
voyage
round
the
world
of
H.M.S.
Beagle
under
command
of
Captaitt
Fitz
Roy
London,
John
Murray
Eds,
Albe-
Street,
1845.
Coral
reefs
constitute
the
most
important
biocon-
of
the
world
with
a
calcitication
rate
of
about
2
â€”
6
kgcaco,
m
yr
'
and
a
distribution
over
about
284
300
km-
.
However,
who
knows
that
this
huge
construction
results
from
the
work
of
small
colonial
organisms
related
to
hydra,
medusa
or
sea
anemone,
the
reef-building
corals'?
These
reefs
are
of
major
im-
not
only
for
marine
ecosystems
and
biodiver-
(tropical
reefs
are
the
most
productive
marine
ecosystem
and
would
host
almost
a
third
of
all
world
fishes),
but
also
for
the
economy
of
numerous
coun-
(tourism,
fishing...),
for
palaeoclimatology
or
ge-
studies...
.
Several
applications
of
coral
reefs
are
known,
from
drugs
isolated
from
organisms
to
the
use
of
coral
skeleton
as
bio-implants
for
human
surgery
.
However,
in
light
of
global
change,
a
decline
of
coral
reefs
has
been
described
worldwide
In
spite
of
this
major
importance,
reef
formation
remains
poorly
known.
Pioneering
work
by
Darwin
was
followed
by
finer
description
of
coral
calcifi-
(see
and
later
).
Nevertheless,
real
physiological
studies
started
after
1950
with
the
works
of
Muscatine
(see
review
in
).
At
the
dawn
of
the
21st
century,
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
coral
calcification
are
still
almost
unknown.
As
other
biom-
coral
skeleton
formation
needs
simultaneously
a
supply
of
ions
and
a
control
by
an
organic
frame-
the
organic
matrix,
present
inside
the
skeleton.
After
a
brief
description
of
coral
anatomy,
we
present
in
this
review
recent
data
regarding
control
of
calcifi-
by
ions
and
organic
matrix
and
some
data
ex-
relationships
between
light
and
calcification.
Environmental
control
of
coral
calcification,
as
well
as
the
experimental
bases
of
the
use
of
coral
skeletons
as
environmental
archives,
will
also
be
presented.
This
review
is
mainly
based
upon
results
obtained
at
the
'Centre
scientifique
de
Monaco',
which
develops
stud-
on
coral
biology
from
the
ecosystem
to
the
colony,
the
microcolony,
the
cell,
and
the
molecule
(for
more
details,
see
other
recent
reviews
)

Definitions
If
the
term
'coral'
is
broadly
used,
paradoxically
it
has
no
valid
taxonomic
definition.
'Coral'
initially
re-
ferred
to
the
Mediterranean
coral,
Corallium
ruhrum
(Anthozoa:
Octocorallia)
with
a
calcitic
skeleton.
Af-
terwards,
it
was
used
to
name
other
Octocorallians,
like
the
blue
coral
(Heliopora),
but
also
Hexacorallians,
like
the
black
coral
with
horny
skeleton,
Antipathes,
or
reef-building
corals
(Scleractinians
or
Madreporaria)
with
aragonitic
skeleton,
or
even
Hydrozoans
like
the
fire
coral
(Millepora).

'coral'
also
designates
Octocorallia
without
hard
skel-
eton,
the
Alcyonarians
(soft
corals!).
Scleractinian
cor-
als
are
known
for
their
skeleton
and
are,
in
this
case,
called
'reef-building
corals'
or
hermatypic
corals
(herm
=
reef).
Hermatypic
corals
host
in
their
tissues
unicellular
Dinoflagellates
symbionts,
commonly
called
zooxanthellae
(Svmbiodinium
sp.)
.
But
all
Scleractinians
are
not
reef
builders
(ahermatypic
cor-
als),
even
if
they
are
characterized
by
their
aragonitic
skeleton.
3.
Nlorpho-functional
anatomy
The
coral
skeleton
is
extracellular,
located
at
the
base
of
coral
tissue,
like
a
finger
covered
by
a
glove.
Hermatypic
corals
are
modular
animals,
constituted
of
similar
units,
the
polyps
resulting
from
a
clonal
repro-
duction
(asexual
reproduction
by
budding).
Each
polyp
looks
like
a
bag
whose
walls
are
made
by
two
layers
of
cells,
an
ectodermal
layer,
and
an
endodermal
layer,
separated
by
a
network
of
collagen,
called
me-
soglea.
The
endodermal
cell
layer
delimits
a
cavity,
the
coelenteron,
with
only
one
opening,
the
mouth,
sur-
rounded
by
tentacles
(of
a
multiple
of
6
=
Hexacoral-
lia).
This
cavity
acts
simultaneously
as
a
gastric
and
circulatory
cavity
between
polyps,
and
is
therefore
also
called
gastro-vascular
cavity.
Polyps
are
linked
together
by
the
coenosarc
made
by
an
oral
(facing
sea
water)
and
an
aboral
(facing
skeleton)
epithelium,
each
of
them
being
composed
of
an
ectodermal
and
an
endodermal
cell
layer
1
Ectoderm
and
endoderm
are
differentiated
between
oral
and
aboral
layers:
most
of
zooxanthellae
are
lo-
cated
within
the
oral
endoderm,
whereas
only
a
few
are
found
in
the
aboral
endoderm.
The
oral
ectoderm
is
thick
(10
to
20
1tm)
and
rich
in
cnidocytes,
whereas
the
aboral
ectoderm,
also
called
calicoblastic
epithelium,
is
flat
(0.5
to
3
Itm)
and
does
not
possess
cnidocytes.
Calicoblastic
epithelium
is
responsible
for
the
forma-
tion
of
the
aragonitic
skeleton.
Calicoblastic
cells
are
long
(10
to
100
Itm),
highly
interdigitated
and
overlap
each
other.
They
contain
numerous
mitochondria,
sug-
gesting
an
active
metabolic
role.
Skeletogenic
cells
are
connected
by
desmosome
junctions
[48,
Tambutte
and
Allemand,
unpublished
data].
They
are
attached
to
the
exoskeleton
by
specialized
cells,
called
desmocytes
.
Cells
are
often
separated
by
large
intercellular
spaces
that
may
contain
circular
vesicles
(50
â€”
70
nm
in
diameter)
thought
to
function
in
exocytotic
transport
of
organic
matrix
.
Consequently,
the
skeletogenic
process
occurs
in
a
'biologically-controlled
medium'
and
is
separated
from
the
external
seawater
by
four
layers
of
cells,
i.e.
at
least
40
â€”
50
Itm
thick.
4.
Biomineralisation:
ions
and
organic
molecules
Composition
of
biominerals
includes
two
fractions,
one
mineral
and
one
organic,
called
organic
matrix,
the
amount
of
each
varying
among
species.
In
Scleractin-
ian
corals,
skeleton
is
made
of
calcium
carbonate
1CaCO,)
crystallized
in
aragonite
(orthorhombic
sys-
tem).
In
order
to
build
their
skeleton,
corals
have
to
supply
calcium
and
inorganic
carbon
from
ambient
seawater
to
the
calcification
site
but
also
to
eliminate
protons
resulting
from
the
mineralising
process:
Ca
+
HCO,
=
CaCO,
+
H'
Epithelial
transport
of
molecules
can
be
achieved
by
two
mechanisms:
a
paracellular
pathway,
between
cells
(in
this
case,
transport
of
the
molecule
is
only
driven
by
its
chemical
gradient,
transport
is
diffusional
and
passive),
or
a
transcellular
pathway
through
cells.
In
this
last
case,
the
molecule
needs
to
enter
the
cell,
cross
the
cell
and
then
exit.
Thus
the
transport
is
active,
against
a
gradient
with
energy
supply.
Transport
of
charged
species
across
the
hydrophobic
cell
membrane
requires
specific
carrier
proteins.
Study
of
coral
calcification
was
for
a
long
time
limited
due
to
methodological
problems
linked
with
the
use
of
radioisotopes,
particularly
4'Ca
.
Before
1990,
most
of
coral
scientists
made
their
experiences
with
freshly-cut
branches
of
corals
(like
Acropora
or
Stylophora),
leading
to
a
naked
skeleton
whose
poros-
ity
facilitated
the
unspecific
adsorption
of
'Ca.
Fur-
thermore,
the
presence
of
a
large
volume
inside
the
coelenteric
cavity
led
to
errors,
because
the
amount
of
radioactive
calcium
in
this
cavity
was
about
53%
of
total
amount
absorbed
by
the
colony
after
30
min
of
incubation
with
'Ca-labelled
seawater
.
There-
fore,
the
lack
of
rinsing
this
cavity
induced
an
impor-
tant
error.
In
order
to
cope
with
this
problem,
research-
ers
from
the
'Centre
scientitique
de
Monaco'
have
set
up
two
important
technological
improvements:
(i)
a
specific

Within

Combining

Tambutte
et

showed
that
the
calicoblastic

is
the
site
of
active

This
transcellular
pathway
involves
L-type

channel
proteins
.
The
ol
subunit
of
this
channel
has
been
cloned
and
immuno-localized
on
the
calicoblastic

.
This
protein,
of
a
calcu-
molecular
mass
of
213.2
kDa
(accession

Opening
of
L-type

is
normally

and
its

is
generally
restricted
to

cells.
Therefore,
its
presence
within
a

carrying
out
large

appears
surprising.
This
paradox
may
be
ex-
by

(Zoccola

showing

Calcification
has
been

to
be
completely
in-

by
the
anion

DIDS
(

suggesting
that
an
anion
carrier
is
involved
in
the
transport
of
DIC
across
the
calicoblastic
cells.
This
anion
carrier
is
likely
located
on
the
calicoblastic
plasma
membrane
adjacent
to
the
skeleton.
Conse-
quently,
sources
of
DIC
are
(1)
metabolic
CO
<
and
(2)
HCO,
directly
absorbed
by
the
calicoblastic
cells
by
a
mechanism
remaining
totally
unknown
(HCOa
chan-
nel
as
reported
in
the
sea
anemone
by
).
The
cyto-
plasmic
carbonic
anhydrase
would
carry
out
the
equi-
librium
between
these
two
forms.
An
anion
exchanger
(perhaps
the
Cl
/HCO,
antiport
known
for
its
sensi-
tivity
to
DIDS,
)
could
then
transfer
HCO,
to
the
site
of
calcification
(secondary
active
transport).
This
raises
the
question
of
the
composition
of
the
fluids
within
the
sub-calicoblastic
space.
Nothing
is
known
about
the
composition
of
this
fluid
in
corals,
and
little
is
known
in
other
calcifying
animals.
It
seems,
how-
ever,
that
the
inorganic
carbon
content
of
this
fluid
is
higher
than
that
of
the
surrounding
medium
in
order
to
reach
the
solubility
product.
In
molluscs,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
dissolved
inorganic
carbon
content
of
the
extrapallial
fluid
is
at
least
2-fold
higher
than
that
of
seawater
.
Among
the
vertebrates,
the
fluid
sur-
rounding
the
otolith
in
tishes
(ke.
the
otolymph)
con-
tains
about
2
â€”
3
fold
more
HCO,
than
the
blood
and
concentrations
of
HCO,
as
high
as
130
mM
have
been
reported
in
the
uterine
fluid
of
chickens
during
eggshell
formation
.
These
data
strongly
suggest
that
an
active
mechanism
of
transport
is
involved
to
supply
carbon
to
the
site
of
calcification.

is
known
about

As
stated
above,

leads
to
H+
production.
These
H+

be
removed
from
the
site
of

by
the

Ca
+/H+-
ATPase.
Preliminary
results
(Zoccola
et
al.,
in
prep.)
suggest
that
regulation
of
pH
in
the
calicoblastic
cells
may
involve
an
H+

ATPase
rather
than
classic
systems
such
as
Na+/H+

(
).
4.2.
Organic
matrix
It
is
now
firmly
established
that
organic
matrix
(OM)
plays
a
major
role
in
biomineralisation:
crystal
nucleation,
micro-
and
macro-regulation
of
crystal
morphology,
mineral
characteristics...
.
As
in
all
other
biominerals,
coral
skeleton
contains
an
organic
matrix
that
represents
less
than
0.01%
of
the
total
weight
of
dry
skeleton
.
While
small
in
quan-
tity,
this
OM
is
nevertheless
essential
for
controlling
the
formation
of
CaCO,
crystals,
since
inhibition
of
the
organic
matrix
synthesis
by
emetin
or
cycloheximide,
or
inhibition
of
the
post-translational
glycosylation
of
the
proteins
by
tunicamycin,
almost
instantaneously
stops
the
calcification
process
.
It
should
be
noted
that
these
inhibitors
do
not
simultaneously
affect
pho-
tosynthesis
and
respiration.
Biochemical
composition
of
OM
in
corals
is
poorly
known,
but
the
presence
of
proteins,
polysaccharides,
glycosaminoglycanes
as
well
as
of
lipid
s
and
chitin
has
been
reported
in
some
species.
While
this
notion
is
presently
questioned
(see
),
OM
is
usually
separated
into
soluble
and
insoluble
matrices.
The

fraction
of
this

This

kDa,
contains
298
amino
acids,
arranged
in
tandem
repeats
of
about
30
amino
acids
rich
in
cystein,
serine
and
glycine.
There
are
only
few
(less
than
10'/
>
:)
acidic
amino
acids.
This
protein
shows
no
homology
with
known
proteins
in
databases.
Very
few
data
exist
on
the
metabolism
of
organic
matrix.
Using
C-labelled
14
aspartic
acid
as
a
precursor
of
organic
matrix,
Allemand
et
al.
showed
that
this
amino
acid
is
rapidly
incorporated
into
tissue
proteins
from
the
external
medium,
suggesting
1i1
that
the
bio-
pathway
is
very
efficient
and
1ii)
that
no
intracellular
pool
of
aspartic
acid
is
present
in
coral
tissue.
After
a
lag
phase
of
20
min,
organic
matrix
proteins
are
incorporated
within
the
skeleton.
This
lag
time
likely
represents
the
exocytosis
of
organic
matrix
and
its
incorporation
into
the
CaCO,
crystal.
Thus
depositions
of
organic
and
inorganic
fractions
of
the
skeleton
are
performed
simultaneously
and
not
se-
as
suggested
in
other
biominerals,
such
as
fish
otoliths
Therefore,
calcification
in
hermatypic
corals
is
con-
both
by
the
cellular
supply
of
ions
(Ca
+,
HCO,
)
and
the
organic
matrix.
The
rate
of
ion
trans-
and
organic
matrix
synthesis
and
exocytosis
is
very
high
(
<
2
min).
Consequently,
calcitication
is
a
highly
biologically
controlled
mechanism.
5.
Interactions
between
photosynthesis
and
calcification
Major
calcifying
organisms
are
also
phototrophs,
either
directly
(coccolithophorids)
or
indirectly
through
symbiosis
(foraminifera,
reef-building
corals).
All
these
organisms
are
responsible
for
the
major
part
of
the
production
of
CaCO,
of
the
earth.
In
these
organisms,
calcification
is
highly
dependent
on
light,
and
values
of
light-enhanced
calcification
up
to
127
have
been
reported,
even
if
the
mean
stimulation
value
is
around
3
1review
by

However,
mechanisms
underlying
these
interactions
are
not
known
and
even
the
terminology
is
discussed
between
light-enhanced
or
dark-repressed
calcitication
1see
discussion
in
1.
Several
mechanisms
have
been
hypothesized
to
explain
these
interactions:
~
modification
of
the
DIC
equilibrium
within
coral
tissues
caused
by
CO,
uptake
for
photosynthesis
~
production
of
energy
by
photosynthesis
~
production
of
0,
by
photosynthesis
~
removal
of
inhibiting
substances
~
synthesis
by
symbionts
of
organic
matrix
molecules
or
precursors
Moditication
of
DIC
equilibrium
may
involve
either
photosynthetic
stimulation
of
calcification
by
lowering
the
CO,
partial
pressure
in
the
coral
tissue,
thus
favour-
carbonate
precipitation
(see
eton
synthetic
quentially,
trolled
port
ing
A)
or
dehydration
of
HCO,
to
CO,
by
H+
produced
during
calcification,
in
turn
stimulating
photosynthesis
(see
B).
Both
hypotheses
assume
that
HCO,
freely
diffuses
into
the
coelenteric
cavity,
which,
as
shown
above,
is
unlikely
to
be
the
case.
Furthermore,
Furla
et
al.
showed
that
light-
enhanced
calcification
is
a
late
process,
occurring
only
10
min
after
the
onset
of
the
photosynthetic
process.
An
alternative
mechanism
may
involve
photo-
synthesis-induced
OH
secretion
within
the
coelen-
teric
cavity
(
C).
This
light-dependent
OH
secre-
tion
may
neutralize
H+
produced
by
CaCO,
precipitation,
thus
allowing
calcitication
to
proceed.
The
net
rate
of
OH
efflux

saturating
irradiance

Notwithstanding

organisms
may
not
be

Another
hypothesis
has
been
recently
suggested
by
the
group
of
J.-P.
Cuif
[2().38].
By
analysing
the
com-
position
in
amino
acids
of
OM
from
13
symbiotic
and
11
non-symbiotic
corals,
they
showed
that
this
compo-
sition
is
dependent
upon
the
presence
of
symbionts.
If
aspartic
acid
remains
the
major
amino
acid
in
both
groups
of
corals,
the
amount
of
glutamic
acid
is
always
higher
in
symbiotic
vs.
non-symbiotic
corals.
Simi-
larly,
threonine
is
high
in
symbiotic
corals
and
low
in
non-symbiotic
ones,
while
the
opposite
is
observed
for
threonine.
OM
content
of
sugars
(mannose,
galactose,
galactosamine,
glucosamine)
is
also
significantly
dif-
ferent
in
the
two
groups
of
corals.
All
these
results
suggest
that
symbionts
may
affect
OM
precursor
syn-
thesis,
or
may
provide
these
precursors.
This
hypoth-
esis
is
not
exclusive
with
that
of
DIC

Environmental

of
coral

One
goal
of
coral-reef
ecologists
is
to
predict
the
effects
of
environmental
conditions
(natural
or
anthro-
pogenic)
on
the
integrity
of
scleractinian
coral
commu-
nities.

and
thus

It
has
become
patently
clear
that
coral
reefs
around
the
world
are
coming
under
increasing
pres-
and
their
status
is
declining
rapidly
.
One
prominent
example
of
stress
is
the
increased
frequency
of
mass
coral
bleaching
events
(loss
of
chlorophyll,
zooxanthellae
and
reduced
calcification)
since
the
early
1980s
.
Corals
are
subject
to
stresses
at
the
local,
regional,
and
global
scales.
At
the
local
and
regional
scale,
reefs
deteriorate
in
all
areas
where
hu-
activities
are
concentrated,
due
to
an
increase
in
seawater
pollution
(heavy
metals,
eutrophication,
bac-
and
viral
diseases),
and
human
pressures
(diving,
fishing,
tourism...).
In
addition
to
these
stresses,
corals
also
experience
the
effect
of
the
'global
change'
i.e.
Increased
seawater
temperature,
ultra-violet
radia-
and
pco
as
well
as
increased
sediment
loading.
Therefore,
major
actions
were
undertaken
to
better
understand
the
effects
of
a
change
in
the
main
environ-
parameters
on
the
survival
of
reef
corals,
and
especially
the
effects
on
their
rates
of
calcification.
Effects
of
eutrophication,
of
increased
pco
levels
and
seawater
temperature
on
coral
calcification
have
at-
scientists'
attention.
Eutrophication
corre-
to
an
increase
in
nutrient
concentrations,
in
sediment
load
and
in
a
development
of
algae,
all
of
them
reducing
light
available
to
the
corals
and
neces-
for
their
calcification.
Laboratory
and
in
situ
ex-
have
also
reported
a
decrease
in
calcification
under
nutrient-enriched
conditions.
At
the
community
level,
Kinsey
and
Davies
measured
a
pronounced
decrease
(50'/L)
in
the
overall
calcitication
following
an
8-month
fertilization
period
of
a
patch
reef
system
in
the
Great
Barrier
Reef.
Tomascik
and
Tomascik
and
Sanders
found
a
correlation
between
anthro-
disturbances
and
decreased
skeletal
growth
in
the
coral
Montastraea
amlularis.
At
the
organism
level,
several
studies
have
monitored
a
lower
calcifica-
under
different
enrichments
in
ammonium,
nitrate,
and
phosphorus
,
up
to
50~/L.
An
iron
enrichment,
often
seen
during
El
Nino
periods,
also
decreases
by
20'/L
the
growth
of
scleractinian
corals
.
The
way
by
which
nutrients
interact
with
calcifi-
is
still
poorly
known.
They
generally
highly
enhance
the
growth
of
the
algal
component,
and
this
might
lead
to
a
disruption
of
the
symbiosis,
and
espe-
the
coupling
between
photosynthesis
and
calci-
Calcification
is
also
affected
by
an
increase
in
the
pco,
which
has
risen
from
280
to
370
latm
since
the
last
century,
as
a
result
of
human
activities
and
could
reach
705
latm
in
year
2100
.
An
increase
in
seawater
pco
induces
a
change
in
the
other
carbon
components
such
as
bicarbonate
(HCOa
)
and
carbon-
(CO,
)
and
corresponds
to
a
decrease
in
CO,
Coral
calcitication
seems
however
intimately
linked
to
the
calcium-carbonate
saturation
state
(o~),
which
is
the
ratio
of
the
ion
concentration
product
([Ca
+]
x
[CO,
])
to
the
solubility
product
of
the
mineral
depos-
Therefore,
a
decrease
in
the
concentration
of
CO,
in
seawater
has
been
related
to
a
sharp
decrease
in
coral
calcification,
at
the
organism
or
community
level
.
Together
with
the
change
in
p+Q,
the
global
warming
also
corresponds
to
an
increase
in
the
mean
sea
surface
temperature,
which
is
expected
to
rise
by
1
â€”
3'C
over
the
coming
century
.
This
is
leading
to
the
frequent
El
Nino
events
.
The
bleaching
and
death
of
the
coral
colonies
after
an
El
Nino
event
is
generally
followed
by
a
strong
coral
bioerosion,
reducing
the
3-D
reef
structure
.
When
both
higher
level
of
pco
and
temperatures
are
com-
coral
calcitication
is
lowered
by
50%
In
conclusion,
coral
reef
ecosystems
are
under
the
threats
of
local
direct
anthropogenic
stresses,
and
of
the
more
extended
stresses
of
global
change,
which
include,
in
addition
to
a
raise
in
temperature
and
p+Q,
an
elevation
of
the
sea
level
and
in
the
ultraviolet
radiations.

(from

and
for

(from

and

are
stored
in
coral
skel-
as
growth

(e.g.,
skeletal

and

Examples
of
informa-
stored
in

include

(SSTs),

and

the
promise

to
yield
similar
fabulous

to
those
obtained
from

has
not
been
yet
realized
despite
extensive
works.
One
problem
is
that
such
proxies
need
to
be
calibrated
before
their
use.
The
great
majority
of
calibrations
have
been
carried
out
in
the
field
(see
for
example
):
however,
calibrations
carried
out
in
the
labo-
under
controlled
conditions
seem
necessary
to
decipher
the
effect
of
each
environmental
parameter
(temperature,
salinity,
light...).
Such
an
approach
has
been
used
successfully
with
foraminifera
(e.g.,
)
but
difficulties
encountered
with
culture
techniques
have
precluded
the
development
of
experimental
cali-
of
proxy
records
in
corals.
However,
recently
several
works
have
been
done
concerning
the
effects
of
several
parameters
(temperature,
light,
nutrition,
pc
o
)
on
coral
isotopic
composition
Recently,
it
has
been
shown
that
isotopic

is
profoundly
influenced
by

Conclusions
This
review
highlights
the
complexity,
but
also
the
weakness
of
our
knowledge
concerning
biomineralisa-
mechanisms
in
corals.
Formation
of
a
coral
skel-
is
the
result
of
complex,
biologically
regulated
phenomenon,
largely
unknown.
Due
to
the
fact
that
coral
reefs
are
presently
disturbed
by
human
activities,
it
is
urgent
to
develop
research
on
coral
biology,
asso-
physiologists,
molecular
and
genome
biolo-
geneticists,
ecologists...
Beyond
the
benefit
for
our
environment,
a
better
knowledge
of
coral
calcifica-
will
help
to
understand
biomineralisation
mecha-
by
themselves,
which
remain
poorly
understood,
even
in
mammals:
"Bone
physiology
is
undoubtedly
the
source
of
many
concepts
of
biomineralization,
but
it
remains
as
one
of
the
few
physiological
processes
for
which
there
is
a
unitied
theory
and
one
of
the
few
medical
interests
that
have
not
benetited
from
com-
studies",
