Climatic
versus
tectonic
factors
in
the
formation
of
the
glaciolacustrine
succession
(
Bełchatów
outcrop
,
central
Poland
)
Abstract
Pleistocene
glaciolacustrine
sediments
of
the
Kleszczów
Graben
(
the
Bełchatów
outcrop
,
central
Poland
)
record
the
origin
,
development
,
and
decay
of
a
glacial
lake
formed
in
the
area
of
a
subsiding
basin
during
the
advance
of
the
Elsterian
ice
sheet
.
The
sediments
represent
a
transition
from
glaciofluvial
to
glaciolacustrine
facies
at
the
bottom
part
,
and
from
glaciolacustrine
to
glacial
facies
at
the
top
.
The
glaciolacustrine
facies
represent
a
few
environments
inside
the
lake
basin
,
from
the
marginal
sub-aqueous
slope
through
the
bottom
part
to
the
sub-aqueous
fan
.
The
contact
of
the
glaciolacustrine
facies
and
the
overlying
glacial
till
is
erosional
,
and
implies
that
a
considerable
part
of
the
shallow-water
lake
facies
was
eroded
.
The
lake
existed
for
not
longer
than
600
years
,
but
its
development
proceeded
under
the
conditions
of
the
Kleszczów
Graben
subsidence
and
the
approach
of
the
Elsterian
ice
sheet
.
Both
factors
influenced
the
sedimentation
processes
.
The
tectonic
and
climatic
factors
were
recognised
on
the
basis
of
facies
analysis
of
lithofacies
associations
,
and
of
their
vertical
and
lateral
changes
.

Introduction
Lake
sediments
constitute
,
as
a
rule
,
the
most
complete
depositional
successions
(
without
erosional
gaps
)
.
They
,
therefore
,
are
the
best
records
of
short-time
Quaternary
climatic
changes
.
Lake
environments
are
extremely
sensitive
to
climatic
changes
:
they
react
with
changes
in
sedimentary
processes
and
consequent
types
of
deposits
.
The
reconstruction
of
climatic
changes
(
in
a
wide
sense
including
seasonal
changes
,
fluctuations
in
temperatures
,
rainfall
and
predominant
wind
directions
)
is
relatively
easily
identified
in
clastic
lake
sediments
formed
at
the
end
of
the
Weichselian
.
This
is
much
more
difficult
in
older
glaciolacustrine
sediments
.
It
must
also
be
stressed
that
not
every
change
in
sedimentation
is
connected
with
climatic
change
(
see
Van
Loon
,
1999a
)
.
The
studied
deposits
result
from
sedimentation
in
a
lake
basin
formed
in
a
graben
,
in
the
foreland
of
the
Elsterian
ice
sheet
during
its
advance
.
The
succession
(
up
to
60
m
thick
)
has
been
perfectly
preserved
,
which
was
possibly
due
to
the
graben
subsidence
.
The
sediments
are
characterised
by
a
wide
scope
of
textural
and
structural
features
reflecting
various
lake
environments
.
The
paper
is
intended
to
recognise
the
lake
depositional
environments
on
the
basis
of
vertical
and
lateral
changes
in
the
lithology
as
well
as
to
define
the
influence
of
both
the
graben
activity
and
the
approaching
ice
sheet
on
the
lake
sedimentation
.
The
vertical
succession
of
the
following
sedimentary
environments
,
in
terms
of
time
and
space
,
permits
to
reconstruct
the
phases
of
the
lake
development
.

Geological
setting
The
Bełchatów
brown-coal
opencast
mine
in
central
Poland
(
Fig.
1A
)
,
filled-in
with
over
200
m
of
Tertiary
and
Quaternary
sediments
,
presents
a
good
opportunity
for
the
investigation
of
glacigenic
facies
.
The
outcrop
is
located
in
the
Kleszczów
Graben
,
in
the
southern
part
of
the
Łódź
Upland
,
within
the
Szczecin-Łódź-Miechów
Synclinorium
(
Pożaryski
,
1977
—
Fig.
1B
)
.
The
graben
is
about
50
km
long
and
4
–
5
km
wide
.
It
originated
due
to
movement
of
faults
in
the
substratum
that
were
reactivated
during
the
Alpine
orogeny
.
The
geology
of
the
graben
is
rather
complex
.
The
basement
,
consisting
of
Carboniferous
sandstones
deformed
during
the
Variscan
orogeny
,
is
overlain
by
sandstones
,
limestones
,
marls
and
shales
of
Mesozoic
age
,
which
together
were
folded
and
faulted
during
the
Laramide
phase
of
the
Alpine
orogeny
Baraniecka
,
1971
and
Brodzikowski
et
al.
,
1987a
.
The
Quaternary
succession
is
50
–
250
m
thick
and
consists
of
glacial
,
glaciolacustrine
,
glaciofluvial
and
fluvial
sediments
.
Non-glacial
deposits
are
of
restricted
occurrence
within
the
graben
(
Fig.
1C
)
.
In
the
light
of
former
studies
by
many
authors
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
graben
was
tectonically
active
during
the
whole
Pleistocene
,
and
continues
to
be
so
today

Several
Scandinavian
glaciations
reached
the
Kleszczów
Graben
area
,
which
is
documented
by
eight
glacial
cycles
within
the
Pleistocene
deposits
Brodzikowski
,
1995
and
Krzyszkowski
,
1995
.
Each
cycle
represents
a
separate
period
of
glacier
advance
and
retreat
.
There
are
two
structural
units
within
the
Quaternary
sediments
separated
by
a
distinct
erosional
surface
(
Fig.
1C
)
called
the
“
main
discordance
surface
”
(
Krzyszkowski
,
1993
)
.
Thirteen
formations
(
understood
as
lithostratigraphic
units
)
representing
particular
glacial
or
interglacial
cycles
are
present
within
the
Quaternary
deposits
exposed
in
the
outcrop
.
The
glaciolacustrine
sediments
are
of
considerable
thickness
and
occur
in
five
glacigenic
formations
:
Folwark
,
Kuców
,
Ławki
and
Stawek
Formations
Krzyszkowski
,
1992
and
Krzyszkowski
,
1993
,
and
additionally
in
the
Rogowiec
Formation
(
Gruszka
,
1998
)
.
The
glaciolacustrine
sediments
of
the
Kuców
Formation
were
investigated
from
1991
to
1994
Fig.
1
and
Fig.
2
.
They
attain
a
maximum
thickness
of
60
m
and
display
a
complex
internal
structure
with
a
large
variability
of
sub-aqueous
sediment
types
.
The
lateral
extent
of
the
glaciolacustrine
lithosome
is
500
–
800
m
.
The
various
glaciolacustrine
facies
(
among
others
,
varved
clays
,
horizontally
laminated
silts
,
rhythmites
of
silts
and
sands
,
and
sands
and
gravels
of
gravity-flow
origin
)
were
erosionally
cut
and
are
covered
by
a
20-m-thick
glacial
till
of
the
Elsterian
glaciation
.
The
sediments
are
bordered
in
the
north
by
a
normal
fault
,
gradually
dying
out
to
the
west
.

Methodology
Field
data
underwent
a
three-step
sedimentological
analysis
.
The
description
of
the
distribution
and
lithology
,
as
well
as
the
genetic
interpretation
of
the
lithofacies
,
are
the
first
steps
of
the
analysis
.
The
lithofacies
are
indicated
by
a
slightly
modified
lithofacies
code
Miall
,
1978
and
Zieliński
,
1995
.
Mixed
symbols
of
texture
are
introduced
,
e.g.
SG
(
gravely
sand
)
or
SF
(
silty
sand
)
,
to
make
the
coding
of
the
lithofacies
more
precise
.
The
letter
v
is
used
to
indicate
the
varved
rhythm
of
deposits
(
in
lithofacies
Fv
)
.
The
used
lithofacies
code
is
presented
in
Table
1
.
The
lithofacies
distribution
was
subsequently
analysed
.
Each
facies
association
is
indicated
by
the
codes
for
the
lithofacies
that
are
most
common
in
the
association
.
Lithofacies
that
are
frequently
present
,
but
do
not
dominate
,
are
indicated
with
brackets
,
e.g.
lithofacies
association
Sm
,
(
Fh
)
.
Lithofacies
associations
are
regarded
as
products
typical
of
the
sedimentary
sub-environment
.
Finally
,
each
distinguished
member
(
the
members
are
indicated
with
capital
letters
)
consists
of
a
set
of
the
related
lithofacies
associations
that
originated
under
similar
sedimentary
conditions
(
e.g.
in
the
central
part
of
a
glacial
lake
)
.

Palaeoenvironments
of
glaciolacustrine
members
The
glaciolacustrine
sediments
of
the
Kuców
Formation
represent
a
complete
succession
of
the
fossil
lake
.
They
include
two
basic
lithological
types
:
clayey
–
silty
and
sandy
or
sandy
–
gravely
deposits
.
These
are
shown
in
a
set
of
the
synthetic
logs
(
Fig.
3
)
.
A
series
of
lithofacies
associations
can
be
eliminated
within
the
glacial
lake
deposits
.
Below
the
typical
glaciolacustrine
sediments
,
sandy
,
gravely
–
sandy
and
gravely
deposits
over
10-m
thick
are
present
.
In
the
lower
part
of
this
package
,
a
large-scale
trough
cross-stratification
(
St
,
SGt
)
predominates
,
which
indicates
an
environment
of
deep
erosional
channels
with
sub-aerial
,
high-energy
,
unsteady
flows
that
are
a
characteristic
feature
of
melt-water
currents
.
In
the
upper
part
of
the
package
,
sands
with
a
large
to
average
thickness
are
interlayered
with
horizontally
laminated
silts
(
lithofacies
associations
Sh
,
(
Fh
)
and
Fh
,
Sm
,
(
Sh
,
Sr
)
)
.
Both
the
thickness
and
the
average
grain-size
of
these
lithofacies
decrease
towards
the
top
.
These
sediments
are
intermediate
between
typically
fluvial
and
glaciolacustrine
.
Detailed
lithological
analysis
of
the
glaciolacustrine
succession
lying
above
allows
distinguishing
five
members
.
4.1
.
Member
A
4.1.1
.
Description
This
member
consists
of
fine-grained
deposits
with
a
predominance
of
silty
and
sandy
–
silty
lithofacies
,
which
make
up
over
60
%
of
the
member
sediments
.
Clayey
lithofacies
make
almost
20
%
and
different
scale
sands
and
sands
with
clayey
clasts
make
the
remaining
part
of
the
sediments
.
There
are
a
few
lithofacies
associations
in
member
A
(
Fig.
3
)
,
with
four
main
lithofacies
types
:
massive
clays
,
horizontally
laminated
silts
,
ripple-cross
laminated
sands
and
normally
graded
sands
(
Fig.
4
)
.
Small-scale
gradational
cycles
are
present
in
all
the
lithofacies
associations
.
The
whole
member
exhibits
an
upward
decrease
in
bed
thickness
.
Silty
–
clayey
rhythmites
of
Fh
,
Fv
lithofacies
association
attain
40
cm
in
thickness
in
the
lower
part
of
the
member
and
diminish
to
4
–
6
cm
in
its
upper
part
(
Fig.
4
—
Fh
,
Fv
assoc.
)
.
The
thickness
of
clayey
laminae
is
rather
constant
,
while
the
silty
laminae
become
thinner
in
an
upward
direction
.
4.1.2
.
Interpretation
The
analysis
indicates
changeable
environmental
conditions
during
sedimentation
.
A
considerable
amount
of
silty
and
sandy
material
was
supplied
from
the
south
and
southwest
(
Fig.
4
)
by
turbidity
currents
generated
probably
by
sediment-laden
rivers
.
In
the
more
central
part
of
the
lake
,
the
material
was
transported
by
saltation
and
traction
,
which
resulted
in
current
structures
in
sands
and
silts
.
Sedimentation
of
the
dispersed
parapelagic
material
took
place
in
breaks
of
currents
activity
.
Distinct
alternation
of
silty
and
sandy
laminae
indicates
pulses
in
the
supply
.
The
trend
of
a
gradual
decrease
in
the
thickness
of
the
silty
–
clayey
rhythmites
suggests
an
environmental
change
from
proximal
to
distal
in
relation
to
the
source
area
.
This
could
be
caused
by
an
enlargement
of
the
lake
area
or
by
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
supplying
river
.
However
,
such
a
trend
could
also
reflect
a
change
in
the
current
character
into
lower-energy
,
although
still
carrying
a
considerable
amount
of
silty
material
.
The
sedimentation
of
member
A
was
dominated
by
turbidity
currents
,
which
resulted
in
sandy
sequences
of
normal
grading
found
in
the
proximal
part
of
the
member
.
Member
A
represents
the
first
phase
of
the
glaciolacustrine
parapelagic
sedimentation
.
The
source
of
the
material
was
relatively
close
to
the
basin
.
The
conditions
of
deposition
evolved
from
more
coarse-grained
associations
in
higher-energy
flows
to
silty
–
clayey
associations
formed
under
diminishing
energy
conditions
.
The
sediments
of
member
A
originated
in
a
marginal
part
of
the
lake
.
4.2
.
Member
B
4.2.1
.
Description
This
20-m-thick
unit
is
the
most
coarse-grained
depositional
complex
in
the
lake
succession
,
revealing
both
vertical
and
lateral
differentiation
in
the
facies
development
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
3
.
The
member
is
built
of
texturally
various
sediments
—
from
sands
with
gravels
to
clays
.
The
sands
and
the
sands
with
gravels
and/or
clayey
clasts
make
almost
70
%
of
the
deposits
.
Sandy
–
silty
,
silty
and
clayey
lithofacies
make
28
%
,
diamictons
2
%
.
Generally
,
thick
beds
of
sand
,
of
sand
with
gravels
and/or
clayey
clasts
are
interbedded
with
horizontally
laminated
silts
and
clays
.
Lithofacies
of
massive
sands
Sm
,
enriched
in
gravels
or
clayey
clasts
,
predominate
in
the
whole
member
,
but
the
largest
thicknesses
of
such
beds
are
noted
in
Sm
,
(
Fh
)
lithofacies
association
(
Fig.
5
)
.
The
frequency
of
normally
(
or
reversed
)
graded
sands
Sg
,
and
sandy
beds
with
a
horizon
of
clayey
clasts
is
also
high
.
Turbidites
are
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
sediments
;
they
frequently
lack
the
upper
part
of
the
sequence
,
so
that
the
most
common
turbidites
consist
of
normally
graded
sands
with
gravels
overlain
by
horizontally
laminated
sands
of
average
scale
:
Sg
→
Sh
(
Fig.
5
—
Sm
,
(
Sh
)
assoc.
)
.
Sometimes
ripple
cross-lamination
is
noted
in
the
upper
part
.
Subordinately
,
there
are
horizontally
laminated
sandy
silts
SFh
,
and
wavy
laminated
silts
SFw
,
overlying
the
horizons
of
fossil
ripples
Sr
,
or
lenticularly
laminated
sandy
silts
SFr
.
In
the
upper
part
of
member
B
,
sandy
lithofacies
are
interbedded
with
clay
varves
(
Fig.
5
—
Sm
,
(
Fv
,
Fh
)
assoc.
)
.
The
contacts
between
the
lithofacies
are
sharp
,
frequently
with
erosional
surfaces
.
In
few
cases
,
deformations
due
to
reversed
density
loading
(
Anketell
et
al.
,
1970
)
were
observed
.
4.2.2
.
Interpretation
During
sedimentation
of
the
member
,
the
lake
was
supplied
with
large
amounts
of
sandy
material
.
Gravity
flows
of
various
types
were
the
main
sedimentological
agents
.
Gravity
flows
noted
within
the
sediments
can
be
divided
into
flows
of
high
density
(
mass
flows
)
,
and
flows
of
low
density
(
fluidal
flows
)
.
Eight
types
of
sub-aqueous
gravity
flow
facies
were
distinguished
within
the
complete
sedimentary
succession
of
glacial
lake
—
from
the
most
dense
debris
flow
to
weak
sub-aqueous
stream
flow
.
A
spatial
changeability
of
flow
types
in
the
direction
from
the
near-shore
zone
to
the
central
part
of
the
lake
,
is
clearly
visible
(
Gruszka
and
Zieliński
,
1996
)
.
Sedimentation
processes
stimulated
by
gravity
flows
alternated
with
periods
of
steady
parapelagic
deposition
from
suspension
.
Debris
flows
,
grain
flows
and
various
transitional
types
are
the
flows
of
high
density
resulted
in
large-scale
massive
sand
beds
with
dispersed
clayey
clasts
or
with
horizons
of
clayey
clasts
.
These
dense
mass
flows
frequently
eroded
the
bottom
of
the
lake
and
previously
deposited
clayey
layers
.
The
fragments
of
such
clayey
layers
were
then
incorporated
into
the
flow
and
transported
to
deeper
parts
of
the
lake
.
Turbidity
currents
were
among
the
flows
of
lower
density
.
They
resulted
in
the
deposition
of
sandy
Bouma
successions
,
much
better
developed
than
the
typical
Quaternary
glaciolacustrine
turbidites
as
described
by
Donnelly
and
Harris
(
1989
)
,
Huff
(
1989
)
and
Liverman
(

.
Several
types
of
sub-aqueous
flows
and
currents
delivered
coarse-grained
material
from
the
southern
and
southwestern
margins
of
the
lake
to
more
distal
lake
parts
.
Between
the
episodes
of
gravity
flows
,
periods
of
steady
sedimentation
from
suspension
took
place
.
After
some
time
,
the
periods
of
flow
decay
became
longer
and
then
the
varves
originated
.
Coarse-grained
sandy
lithofacies
commonly
alternates
with
fine-grained
silty
and
clayey
ones
.
The
deposits
of
complex
B
originated
in
distal
,
transitional
and
proximal
zones
,
depending
on
sedimentary
processes
,
energy
,
and
the
proximity
to
the
source
area
.
The
following
model
presents
the
sedimentation
of
member
B
(
Fig.
5
)
.
From
the
southern
and
southwestern
part
of
the
lake
,
dense
mass
flows
spread
downslope
.
The
sub-aqueous
slope
was
possibly
gentle
.
According
to
Stow
,
1986
and
Stow
,
1994
dense
mass
flows
can
be
set
in
motion
at
a
slope
of
about
1
°
.
The
only
type
of
flow
that
needs
a
steep
slope
to
start
moving
,
i.e.
above
18
°
according
to
Stow
(
1994
)
or
even
above
30
°
according
to
Bagnold
(
1954
)
and
Middleton
(
1970
)
,
is
the
true
grain
flow
—
quasi-visco-plastic
flow
of
cohesionless
grains
.
Such
deposits
were
not
found
in
member
B
,
but
many
transitional
forms
are
present
,
being
an
effect
of
intermediate
conditions
between
the
cohesion
and
cohesionless
debris
flow
(
Postma
,
1986
)
.
The
flows
changed
their
rheological
character
while
moving
downslope
.
The
dense
flows
transformed
into
more
fluidised
,
less
dense
ones
.
They
were
deposited
by
freezing
but
their
movement
induced
next
episodes
of
the
sediment
gravity
transport
.
One
type
of
a
flow
could
change
into
another
by
fluidisation
,
changing
of
the
energy
or
slope
inclination
Postma
,
1984
and
Brodzikowski
,
1993
.
In
a
more
distal
part
of
the
lake
,
the
flows
were
rare
;
only
occasionally
these
areas
were
reached
by
bottom
currents
.
In
“
quiet
”
periods
,
the
silts
and
clay
suspended
in
the
water
slowly
settled
on
the
bottom
,
forming
horizontally
or
wavy
laminated
layers
.
In
long
periods
embracing
summer
and
winter
,
parapelagic
varves
originated
.
Was
the
river
embouching
in
the
lake
from
the
south
the
only
reason
for
gravity-flow
activity
?
Coarse-grained
beds
alternating
with
finer-grained
material
indicate
cyclic
sedimentation
.
The
contribution
of
gravity-flow
sediments
is
very
large
in
the
lower
part
of
the
lithosome
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
quarry
,
while
periods
without
gravity
flow
activity
gain
in
frequency
in
the
upper
part
and
in
western
direction
.
If
the
river
had
supplied
all
material
to
the
lake
,
the
facies
distribution
should
have
been
more
regular
,
especially
because
the
extraglacial
river
was
much
more
regular
than
a
proglacial
one
.
The
gravity-flow
sediments
would
have
been
distributed
over
the
whole
lake
.
Slope
instability
could
not
explain
so
many
,
and
so
dense
gravity
flows
either
.
The
fact
that
the
lake
originated
in
the
active
graben
suggests
tectonic
activity
as
a
trigger
for
the
gravity
flows
.
Even
slight
shocks
caused
by
tectonic
pulses
could
be
sufficient
to
set
the
slope
sediments
in
motion
.
Member
B
is
interpreted
as
originated
in
a
relatively
deep
lake
,
along
the
sub-aqueous
marginal
slope
.
The
sediments
could
thus
form
a
sub-aqueous
fan
.

Member
C
4.3.1
.
Description
Member
C
is
16-m
thick
and
built
of
lithofacies
associations
characterised
by
the
predominance
of
clays
and
silts
,
mainly
varves
Fv
,
or
horizontally
laminated
silts
Fh
(
Fig.
3
)
.
Fine-grained
sediments
(
clays
,
silts
and
sandy
silts
)
build
90
%
of
the
complex
,
and
clayey
lithofacies
alone
make
50
%
.
The
rest
are
sands
(
9
%
)
and
diamictons
(
up
to
1
%
)
.
Regarding
the
commonly
low
rate
of
the
sedimentation
of
fine-grained
deposits
,
it
can
be
stated
that
member
C
represents
the
longest
period
of
steady
parapelagic
sedimentation
.
Over
300
varves
were
found
in
the
succession
.
There
are
some
other
sediments
intercalated
between
the
varves
,
which
point
at
more
diversified
sedimentological
processes
.
Some
sand
grains
are
frequently
noted
in
clay
laminae
.
There
are
also
horizontally
laminated
or
ripple
cross-laminated
sands
and
small-scale
sands
of
normal
grading
among
the
varves
.
Sporadically
,
small-scale
diamictons
form
thin
layers
(
sometimes
lenses
)
up
to
0.5
cm
(
Fig.
6
)
.
A
few
dropstones
were
found
,
up
to
4
cm
in
diameter
.
Palaeoflow
directions
show
the
supply
of
sandy
material
mainly
from
the
south
.
4.3.2
.
Interpretation
The
whole
complex
originated
under
steady
conditions
favouring
parapelagic
deposition
.
In
a
proximal
part
of
the
lake
,
close
to
the
sub-aqueous
slope
,
parapelagic
sedimentation
was
interrupted
occasionally
by
turbidity
currents
and
dense
mass
flows
,
transporting
sandy
material
.
At
some
distance
from
the
marginal
slope
,
gravity
flows
were
rare
,
but
this
zone
was
reached
by
turbidity
currents
.
Close
to
the
central
part
of
the
lake
,
sedimentation
from
suspension
prevailed
and
the
sediments
underwent
reworking
by
weak
traction
currents
.
The
sediments
of
this
part
of
member
C
can
be
considered
as
“
parapelagic
suspension
deposits
”
.
The
term
“
parapelagic
suspension
”
was
proposed
by
Brodzikowski
(
1993
)
for
the
lacustrine
environment
,
on
the
basis
of
the
deposits
and
processes
similarities
between
the
lacustrine
and
marine
environments
(
compare
pelagic
suspension
—
Miall
,
1983
,
Miall
,
1985
and
Eyles
et
al.
,
1985
)
.
The
presence
of
gravel-size
grains
within
clay
laminae
can
be
explained
as
ice-rafted
material
but
sand
grains
in
the
clayey
lithofacies
deserve
explanation
that
is
more
detailed
.
Either
the
grains
are
found
dispersed
in
the
upper
part
of
the
graded
clayey
laminae
or
they
form
thin
films
overlying
the
clayey
laminae
.
Fine
sand
and
silty
sand
may
have
been
blown
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
have
been
able
to
remain
on
the
surface
due
to
the
surface
tension
.
Strong
winds
and
waves
or
rainfalls
could
subsequently
result
in
sinking
of
the
entire
number
of
grains
from
the
surface
to
the
bottom
,
thus
creating
sandy
laminae
(
Brodzikowski
,
1993
)
.
There
are
,
however
,
other
possibilities
that
can
not
be
excluded
beforehand
:
•
sand
grains
were
set
free
after
undermelting
of
ice-rafts
,
•
sand
grains
were
blown
on
the
lake
's
ice-cover
and
sunk
after
thawing
of
the
ice
.
In
both
cases
,
the
individual
grains
could
not
fall
down
during
winter
time
.
In
any
case
,
such
deposits
prove
the
freezing
of
the
lake
and
the
existence
of
ice-cover
in
a
large
part
of
the
year
.
Lenticularly
shaped
,
thin
diamictons
seem
to
have
the
similar
origin
.
Such
deposits
are
mostly
reported
from
the
ice
contact
environment
Eyles
et
al.
,
1983
and
Brodzikowski
and
Van
Loon
,
1991
.
The
lack
of
other
sediments
typical
of
this
environment
does
not
however
support
such
an
interpretation
.
The
sedimentary
environment
of
member
C
is
interpreted
as
the
central
lake
bottom
.
In
its
proximal
part
,
a
certain
amount
of
gravity
flow
deposits
originated
,
which
are
transitional
between
members
B
and
C
.
These
proximal
associations
are
equivalent
to
the
III
intermediate
glaciolacustrine
facies
(
Ashley
,
1989
)
.
In
the
most
distal
area
of
the
lake
,
parapelagic
sediments
were
formed
,
comparable
with
the
IV
distal
glaciolacustrine
facies
(
Ashley
,
1989
)
.
In
the
whole
member
,
clay
varves
predominate
,
and
sedimentation
from
suspension
was
the
main
sedimentological
process
.
Suspended
material
was
distributed
mainly
by
turbidity
currents
,
with
less
contribution
by
thermocline
and
subsurface
plumes
.

Member
D
4.4.1
.
Description
Embedded
in
the
deposits
of
member
C
,
a
lenticularly
shaped
horizon
of
silty
sandy
deposits
is
present
.
It
is
2
m
thick
and
over
100
m
wide
Fig.
2
and
Fig.
3
.
This
is
member
D
,
in
which
sandy
silty
lithofacies
make
almost
70
%
of
deposits
.
Member
D
is
built
of
sandy
silts
with
lenticular
or
flaser
lamination
as
well
as
ripple
and
climbing
ripple
cross-laminated
sands
,
which
together
contribute
an
SFr
lithofacies
association
(
Fig.
7
)
.
The
thickness
of
cosets
of
cross
laminated
sands
and
silty
sands
is
large
—
from
40
to
120
cm
.
The
successions
frequently
show
an
upward
decrease
in
average
grain
size
.
4.4.2
.
Interpretation
The
sedimentation
of
member
D
was
connected
most
probably
with
a
period
of
bottom-current
activity
in
the
deepest
,
channel-shaped
part
of
the
lake
.
During
short
intervals
of
diminished
currents
,
sedimentation
from
suspension
dominated
.
The
lenticular
shape
of
member
D
results
from
the
filling-in
of
the
sub-aqueous
channel
.
The
existence
of
such
channels
in
fine-grained
lacustrine
deposits
was
reported
earlier
from
the
Kleszczów
Graben
by
Hałuszczak
(
1980
)
and
Brodzikowski
(
1993
)
,
who
however
interpreted
them
as
channels
cutting
a
sub-aqueous
fan
surface
.
This
does
not
apply
to
the
single
channel
within
the
deposits
dominated
by
varves
.
Channels
in
other
glaciolacustrine
environment
have
been
reported
quite
frequently
Houbolt
and
Jonker
,
1968
,
Irwin
,
1980
and
Lambert
and
Giovanoli
,
1988
.
Although
the
channels
in
the
clayey
material
are
relatively
rare
phenomena
,
Billi
et
al.
(
1991
)
reported
deep
channels
with
steep
slopes
within
the
clayey
deposits
of
the
lake
bottom
.
The
presence
of
the
channel
is
evidence
for
a
change
in
the
hydrodynamic
conditions
within
the
lake
,
e.g.
a
considerable
lowering
of
the
water
level
,
and
a
temporary
translocation
of
the
proximal
zone
into
the
direction
of
the
central
lake
.
This
may
have
been
caused
by
a
short-lived
outflow
of
the
lake
water
,
which
resulted
in
an
increasing
erosional
capacity
of
the
currents
,
and
thus
in
erosion
of
the
channel
.
After
some
time
,
the
head
of
water
came
to
the
previous
level
(
the
outflow
was
blocked
)
,
and
the
conditions
favourable
to
varve
sedimentation
came
back
.

.
Member
E
4.5.1
.
Description
This
10-m-thick
member
is
the
only
one
with
80
%
of
fine
sands
and
silts
.
The
silty
lithofacies
make
only
15
%
of
the
member
,
the
remaining
5
%
is
constituted
by
clays
and
sands
.
The
most
characteristic
feature
of
the
sediments
is
that
the
current-derived
lithofacies
alternates
with
the
suspension-derived
ones
.
Sands
or
sandy
silts
with
ripple
or
climbing
ripple
cross-laminations
,
Sr
,
SFr
,
are
the
most
frequent
.
They
are
commonly
overlain
by
wavy
laminated
silts
Fw
,
or
by
sandy
silts
of
lenticular
lamination
SFr
(
Fig.

)
.
In
the
upper
part
of
the
member
,
the
massive
sands
appear
,
in
beds
up
to
20-cm
thickness
.
Two
basic
features
are
characteristic
of
member
E
,
and
are
observed
only
within
this
member
:
•
an
increase
in
average
grain
size
towards
the
top
,
together
with
a
simultaneous
increase
in
the
bed
thickness
,
•
the
presence
of
current
structures
indicating
supply
from
the
north
and
northeast
,
or
northwest
.
4.5.2
.
Interpretation
Bottom
currents
were
the
main
agents
during
the
sedimentation
of
member
E
.
They
transported
the
fine-grained
material
in
large
amount
,
resulting
quite
frequently
in
thick
cosets
of
sands
and
sandy
silts
with
climbing
ripple
cross-lamination
.
During
periods
of
flow
waning
currents
,
sedimentation
from
suspension
prevailed
.
The
sediment
features
mentioned
above
indicate
a
facies
shift
into
proximal
direction
.
During
the
accumulation
of
the
complex
,
both
the
energy
of
the
currents
and
the
amount
of
material
supplied
increased
.
As
mentioned
before
,
the
material
was
delivered
from
the
north
,
so
that
a
proglacial
river
flowing
from
the
ice
sheet
towards
the
south
was
probably
the
main
source
.
Fine-grained
deposits
without
diamictons
intercalations
suggest
however
that
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
relatively
far
from
the
depositional
site
.
The
current
energy
decreased
so
much
that
almost
no
coarse-grained
material
reached
the
lake
.
Nevertheless
,
the
river
water
was
still
heavier
than
the
lake
water
because
of
the
suspended
material
,
and
most
probably
because
of
its
lower
temperature
.
In
contact
with
the
lake
water
,
it
therefore
moved
as
undercurrents
over
the
gently
inclined
sub-aqueous
slope
.
While
moving
,
the
undercurrents
quickly
lost
their
last
coarse-grained
material
.
When
the
slope
inclination
decreased
the
finer-grained
particles
could
accumulate
.
There
are
no
features
suggesting
marginal
or
shore
facies
.
It
seems
that
member
E
originated
in
the
zone
close
to
the
proglacial
river
mouth
.
Most
probably
,
it
accumulated
on
the
outer
part
of
the
sub-aqueous
fan
formed
close
to
the
river
inlets
to
the
lake
.
The
character
of
the
sediments
resembles
the
prodelta
or
the
lower
delta
foreset
facies
(
Smith
and
Ashley
,
1985
)
,
and
can
be
identified
with
the
II
proximal
glaciolacustrine
facies
(
Ashley
,
1989
)
.
Lack
of
the
upper
parts
of
the
delta
makes
the
interpretation
not
fully
convincing
.
However
,
the
glacial
till
covering
member
E
suggests
a
potential
erosion
of
the
upper
delta
segments
.
It
is
also
possible
that
it
was
a
Hjulström-type
delta
,
i.e.
without
a
foreset
part
.
In
case
of
a
slope
of
less
than
3
°
,
foresets
,
being
as
a
rule
indicative
for
a
delta
,
will
not
be
formed
(
Dunne
and
Hempton
,
1984
)
.
Taking
into
account
the
investigations
of
contemporary
delta
growth
in
proglacial
areas
Southard
et
al.
,
1972
,
Pharo
and
Carmack
,
1979
and
Chikita
et
al.
,
1991
,
which
is
in
average
7.5
cm/year
,
member
E
could
be
deposited
in
a
period
of
about
150
years
.
The
succession
of
member
E
,
representing
proximal
deposits
and
processes
,
marks
a
regression
of
the
lake
.
Comparable
regressive
successions
revealed
by
an
increase
in
grain
size
towards
the
top
were
reported
from
pre-Quaternary
deposits
Coventry
,
1976
and
Heward
,
1978
.
Such
delta
facies
are
thought
to
be
common
in
regressive
lake
successions
(
Mastalerz
and
Nehyba
,
1997
)
,
and
even
responsible
for
the
end
of
lake
sedimentation
.

Evolution
of
the
glaciolacustrine
basin
The
lithofacies
analysis
allows
distinguishing
five
lithological
members
that
were
formed
in
various
sedimentary
environments
.
Generally
,
dense
mass
flows
are
characteristic
of
member
B
,
whereas
turbidity
currents
strongly
influenced
the
sedimentation
of
members
A
and
B.
Though
traction
currents
were
essential
during
the
sedimentation
of
all
the
members
,
they
fulfilled
a
major
role
during
the
sedimentation
of
members
D
and
E.
Sedimentation
from
suspension
predominated
during
the
origin
of
the
varves
of
member
C
,
but
also
contributed
considerably
to
the
sedimentation
of
other
members
.
The
development
of
the
lake
can
be
subdivided
into
seven
phases
,
each
of
which
is
characterised
by
a
specific
sediment
package

Three
stages
of
the
parapelagic
sedimentation
occurred
,
interrupted
by
stages
of
density
flows
and
bottom-current
activity
.
The
bottom
part
of
lake
succession
records
the
transition
from
the
glaciofluvial
conditions
through
a
transitional
phase
to
glaciolacustrine
one
.
Member
A
represents
the
older
glaciolacustrine
deposits
.
They
document
the
first
stage
of
parapelagic
sedimentation
,
and
a
second
phase
in
the
lake
development
.
Supposedly
,
the
lake
was
quite
deep
,
and
froze
during
winter
time
.
The
character
of
the
deposits
suggests
enlargement
of
the
lake
basin
.
The
steady
parapelagic
sedimentation
was
interrupted
by
a
series
of
gravity
flows
,
responsible
for
sedimentation
of
the
coarse-grained
material
on
the
lake
bottom
(
member
B
—
the
third
phase
of
the
lake
development
—
Table
2
)
.
The
gravity
flows
originated
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
lake
.
As
a
result
of
lake
deepening
—
most
probably
a
consequence
of
graben
activity
—
the
sediments
lost
their
stability
due
to
rapid
change
in
slope
inclination
.
The
reworked
deposits
are
found
,
regularly
noted
at
first
,
but
becoming
less
frequent
with
time
,
which
suggests
stabilisation
of
the
slope
.
The
longest
period
of
steady
parapelagic
sedimentation
is
reflected
by
over
300
varves
.
The
steady
conditions
were
suddenly
interrupted
by
bottom
currents
acting
in
the
deepest
,
axial
part
of
the
lake
,
which
resulted
in
the
sedimentation
of
member
D
.
The
enhanced
bottom-current
activity
lasted
for
a
short
time
,
and
effected
only
a
part
of
the
lake
bottom
.
Nevertheless
,
this
marks
a
separate
phase
of
lake
development
,
which
divides
the
sedimentation
of
member
C
into
two
separate
parapelagic
phases
(
the
fourth
and
sixth
phases
—
Table
2
)
.
In
the
last
phase
of
lake
evolution
,
the
lake
became
within
reach
of
a
proglacial
river
.
The
rate
of
aggradation
was
so
fast
that
sedimentation
from
suspension
stopped
prevailing
,
but
it
still
occurred
.
The
lake
became
shallower
,
being
successively
filled
up
with
the
sediments
supplied
by
the
proglacial
river
.
The
investigated
glaciolacustrine
sediments
thus
represent
formation
,
development
and
disappearance
of
the
lake
.
The
transgression
–
regression
development
of
the
proglacial
lake
did
not
take
longer
than
600
years
.

Tectonic
versus
climatic
control
of
sedimentation
in
the
lake
basin
—
discussion
and
conclusions
The
succession
of
the
glaciolacustrine
lake
in
the
Kleszczów
Graben
area
,
in
the
foreland
of
the
Elsterian
ice
sheet
,
reflect
a
complex
evolution
of
the
lake
basin
.
Both
the
tectonic
activity
and
the
ice
sheet
influenced
the
character
of
the
basin
,
and
thus
also
the
sedimentary
development
.
The
lake
existed
for
a
geologically
short
interval
.
It
was
the
graben
subsidence
that
must
be
held
responsible
for
the
sedimentation
of
such
thick
series
of
deposits
.
The
subsidence
was
also
responsible
for
a
relatively
deep
lake
basin
,
most
probably
also
for
steep
sub-aqueous
slopes
and
for
the
oblong
shape
of
the
glaciolacustrine
lithosome
,
matching
the
shape
of
the
graben
.
These
features
,
together
with
the
coexistence
of
coarse-grained
gravity-flow
deposits
and
fine-grained
glaciolacustrine
ones
,
are
sufficient
to
interpret
the
lake
as
having
been
influenced
by
tectonic
activity
(
Basilici
,
1996
)
.
The
presence
of
gravity-flow
deposits
forming
a
single
,
relatively
uniform
member
,
reflects
tectonic
activity
of
the
graben
,
which
caused
violent
resedimentation
of
material
accumulated
before
on
the
sub-aqueous
slopes
.
Thus
,
member
B
,
being
the
sedimentary
result
of
these
processes
,
is
more
than
indirect
proof
of
simultaneous
subsidence
of
the
graben
during
sedimentation
.
The
analysed
basin
existed
in
the
proglacial
zone
of
the
Elsterian
ice
sheet
,
but
for
most
part
of
its
development
,
material
was
supplied
from
the
opposite
site
.
In
the
final
phase
of
the
lake
,
the
direction
of
supply
was
changed
:
a
southward
flowing
proglacial
river
carried
large
amounts
of
suspended
material
to
the
lake
.
Flowing
into
the
lake
,
the
cold
and
particle-laden
river
water
ran
as
underflows
,
gradually
depositing
its
material
.
The
lake
then
underwent
a
considerable
shallowing
,
to
be
finally
filled
up
with
sediments
proving
that
the
sedimentation
rate
was
higher
than
the
subsidence
.
The
Elsterian
ice
sheet
advanced
over
the
graben
area
;
its
maximal
extent
was
about
200
km
further
south
(
Lindner
and
Marks
,
1995
)
.
The
proximal
character
of
the
sediments
supplied
from
the
north
(
documented
by
coarsening-upward
successions
)
point
to
a
change
in
time
of
the
river
character
,
caused
possibly
by
the
ice
sheet
advance
.
It
is
worth
considering
whether
other
members
reacted
to
the
environmental
changes
in
connection
with
the
transgression
.
The
members
A
and
C
are
interpreted
as
formed
on
a
plain-lake
bottom
.
They
are
divided
by
member
B
,
representing
tectonic
activity
.
The
deposits
do
not
show
any
information
about
climatic
changes
in
the
graben
area
in
spite
of
distinct
sedimentary
differences
between
members
A
and
C
.
These
can
be
ascribed
to
lake-basin
enlargement
and
deepening
resulting
from
graben
tectonics
.
Member
A
lacks
the
explicit
traces
of
long-term
lake
freezing
that
are
present
in
member
C.
Lake
freezing
can
be
an
indirect
indication
of
climatic
cooling
.
The
episode
of
the
lake
drainage
,
reflected
in
the
sediments
of
member
D
,
can
be
related
to
changes
in
the
river
system
in
the
surrounding
area
.
Yet
,
it
is
difficult
to
decide
whether
this
change
was
also
related
with
ice-sheet
advance
,
or
with
basement
subsidence
.
The
approaching
glacier
could
activate
previously
“
sleeping
”
faults
,
and
thus
could
change
the
drainage
system
.
The
climatic
changes
,
which
the
author
hopes
to
have
proved
sufficiently
,
induced
advance
of
the
active
ice
sheet
,
and
not
only
the
ice-marginal
fluctuations
that
are
not
necessary
results
of
climatic
changes
(
cf.
Clark
,
1994
,
as
quoted
by
Teller
,
1999
)
.
The
glaciolacustrine
sediments
covered
by
the
Elsterian
till
prove
the
successive
occurrence
of
two
climate-induced
environmental
conditions
.
Taking
into
account
the
three
categories
of
climate
changes
(
abrupt
,
gradual
and
at
a
geological
time
scale
—
Van
Loon
,
1999b
)
the
above-mentioned
change
in
climate
must
be
considered
as
intermediate
between
abrupt
and
gradual
.
In
the
sediments
,
this
period
is
represented
by
the
regressive
part
of
the
lake
succession
,
up
to
the
erosional
contact
produced
by
the
overlying
till
.
The
sedimentary
processes
involved
did
not
take
longer
than
200
years
(
including
deposition
of
the
material
that
was
partly
eroded
)
.
To
resume
,
both
tectonics
and
climate
influenced
the
lake
development
.
Its
origin
was
a
direct
consequence
of
graben
subsidence
.
The
lake
underwent
several
phases
during
its
short
time
of
the
existence
,
marked
by
distinct
changes
in
lithology
.
Tectonic
subsidence
resulted
in
an
increased
potential
of
preservation
.
Short-term
tectonic
activity
(
earthquakes
)
caused
rapid
resedimentation
of
superficial
deposits
,
on
the
sub-aqueous
slope
.
The
changes
in
sedimentation
reflect
the
approaching
ice
sheet
,
which
can
be
considered
as
a
result
of
climate
cooling
.
The
ice
advance
affected
the
drainage
system
in
the
surrounding
area
and
,
in
the
end
,
the
ice
sheet
itself
became
the
indirect
source
of
material
supplied
to
the
lake
and
causing
its
disappearance
.
