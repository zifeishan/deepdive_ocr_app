Abstract
A
new
109
year
numerical
wind-wave
hindcast
is
developed
for
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
based
on
the
20th
century
atmospheric
reanalysis
(
20CR
)
.
Wave
results
are
validated
directly
against
data
originating
from
voluntary
observing
ships
and
satellite
altimetry
in
the
North-East
Atlantic
Ocean
.
The
normalized
error
for
yearly-mean
significant
wave
height
(
H
s
)
is
shown
to
be
of
the
order
of
5
%
for
the
second
part
of
the
20th
century
.
An
indirect
validation
is
also
performed
through
10
m
wind
speed
and
suggests
that
the
accuracy
of
yearly-mean
H
s
only
slightly
decreases
for
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
.
The
comparison
between
H
s
and
the
index
of
the
North
Atlantic
Oscillation
revealed
that
this
phenomenon
partly
controls
H
s
inter-annual
variability
,
with
a
positive
(
negative
)
correlation
in
the
northeastern
(
southwestern
)
part
of
the
study
area
.
The
analysis
of
model
results
shows
an
increase
in
H
s
over
the
whole
North
Atlantic
Ocean
superimposed
to
the
inter-annual
variability
,
reaching
0.01
m.yr
−
1
(
20
to
40
%
over
the
20th
century
)
north
of
50
°
N
.
This
increase
is
explained
by
a
rise
in
wind
speed
exceeding
20
%
north
of
50
°
N
.
The
roughening
in
the
wave
climate
demonstrated
in
this
study
is
expected
to
have
strong
implications
for
the
development
of
coastal
zones
and
could
explain
the
increase
in
erosion
along
the
North
Atlantic
shorelines
.

Introduction
Ocean
wind-waves
are
relevant
for
numerous
engineering
and
scientific
questions
,
both
in
coastal
zones
and
in
the
deep
ocean
.
Nevertheless
,
the
proper
characterization
of
wave
height
inter-annual
variability
and
the
depiction
of
long-term
trends
require
long-term
times
series
while
wave
data
are
almost
inexistent
prior
to
1950
.
Compared
to
local
measurements
,
wave
height
data
derived
from
satellite
(
Bauer
,
2001
and
Woolf
et
al.
,
2002
)
offers
the
unique
advantage
of
a
global
coverage
.
Thus
,
Young
et
al.
(
2011
)
found
a
general
global
upward
trend
for
wind
speed
and
significant
wave
height
(
H
s
)
over
the
period
1985
–
2008
,
this
rate
being
larger
for
the
90th
and
99th
percentiles
.
However
,
the
24-year
covered
period
is
too
short
to
conclude
whether
this
upward
trend
results
from
inter-annual
or
inter-decadal
variability
or
a
long
term
trend
driven
by
global
change
.
Wave
height
derived
from
Voluntary
Observing
Ships
(
hereafter
VOS
)
was
shown
to
constitute
an
interesting
approach
(
Gulev
et
al.
,
2003
and
Gulev
and
Grigorieva
,
2004
)
,
although
observations
are
restricted
mostly
to
the
main
commercial
routes
and
become
very
scarce
prior
to
1950
.
Alternatively
,
the
availability
of
long-term
atmospheric
reanalyzes
,
such
as
the
ERA-40
project
(
Uppala
et
al.
,
2005
)
or
the
NCEP/NCAR
project
(
Kalnay
et
al.
,
1996
)
together
with
significant
improvements
of
the
predictive
skills
of
wind-wave
models
(
e.g.
Janssen
,
2008
)
allowed
for
the
development
of
accurate
long-term
numerical
hindcasts
(
Cox
and
Swail
,
2001
,
Dodet
et
al.
,
2010
,
Reistad
et
al.
,
2011
,
Charles
et
al.
,
2012
and
Reguero
et
al.
,
2012
)
.
Dodet
et
al.
(
2010
)
showed
an
increase
in
wave
height
reaching
up
to
0.02
m.yr
−
1
in
the
North-East
Atlantic
Ocean
over
the
period
1952
–
2010
,
although
this
increase
was
partly
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
North
Atlantic
Oscillation
(
hereafter
NAO
)
index
(
Hurrell
,
1995
)
over
this
period
.
The
recent
availability
of
the
twentieth
century
atmospheric
reanalysis
(
hereafter
20CR
,
Compo
et
al.
,
2011
)
provides
the
unique
opportunity
to
extend
a
wave
hindcast
over
the
whole
20th
century
.
This
study
presents
the
results
of
a
new
numerical
wave
hindcast
spanning
from
1900
to
2008
and
investigates
the
existence
of
long
term
trends
superimposed
on
the
inter-annual
variability
.

Methods
and
data
2.1
.
The
numerical
model
We
developed
a
new
numerical
wave
hindcast
based
on
the
spectral
wave
model
WaveWatch
III
(
Tolman
,
2009
)
,
which
solves
the
wave
action
equation
on
regular
grids
using
finite
differences
.
A
1
°
resolution
computational
grid
was
implemented
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
(
80
°
W
–
10
°
E
;
0
°
N
–
80
°
N
,
Fig.
1
)
.
The
physical
and
numerical
parameterizations
are
the
same
as
described
by
Dodet
et
al.
(
2010
)
.
Sea-ice
modifies
the
fetch
according
to
a
seasonal
cycle
and
was
thus
taken
into
account
.
Sea-ice
data
provided
with
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
only
available
at
a
1.875
°
spatial
resolution
,
which
is
too
coarse
for
our
numerical
hindcast
.
Alternatively
,
we
defined
an
annual
synthetic
cycle
with
a
1-month
interval
averaging
high-resolution
(
0.5
°
)
sea-ice
predictions
over
the
period
1982
–
2010
(
Fig.
1
)
originating
from
the
NOAA
OI
SST
V2
reanalysis
(
Reynolds
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
model
was
forced
with
3-hourly
wind
fields
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
V2
(
Compo
et
al.
,
2011
)
.
This
atmospheric
reanalysis
assimilates
pressure
observation
and
the
data
considered
in
this
study
corresponds
to
the
ensemble-mean
data
provided
over
a
1.875
°
∗
1.875
°
grid
.
However
,
20CR
ensemble-mean
wind
fields
are
expected
to
be
too
smooth
in
the
end
of
the
19th
century
(
Wang
et
al.
,
in
press
)
,
which
is
a
major
limitation
to
force
a
dynamical
wave
hindcast
.
In
particular
,
extreme
winds
from
the
ensemble-mean
were
shown
to
be
low-biased
(
Bronnimann
et
al.
,
2012
)
for
this
period
.
These
limitations
explain
why
this
study
was
restricted
to
the
analysis
of
yearly-mean
wave
heights
in
the
20th
century
.
Finally
,
3-hourly
time
series
of
wave
heights
were
archived
at
each
grid
node
and
long-term
trends
were
computed
using
a
Huber
robust
regression
method
(
Huber
,
1981
)
.
This
analysis
was
restricted
to
an
area
spanning
70
°
W
–
10
°
E
and
20
°
N
–
70
°
N
(
Fig.
1
)
,
which
corresponds
to
the
area
where
field
observations
were
available
for
validation
.
2.2
.
Validation
of
input
wind
fields
The
key
issue
when
performing
a
wave
hindcast
over
such
a
long
period
is
the
consistency
of
the
input
wind
fields
along
the
time
.
In
order
to
verify
the
quality
of
the
20CR
reanalysis
along
the
20th
century
,
we
performed
a
point-by-point
comparison
with
sea-level
pressure
(
SLP
)
and
10
m
wind
speed
(
U
10
)
originating
from
VOS
data
reported
in
the
ICOADS
database
(
International
Comprehensive
Ocean
–
Atmosphere
Data
Set
,
Woodruff
et
al.
,
2011
)
.
This
data
was
not
assimilated
in
the
20CR
and
thereby
allows
for
an
independent
validation
.
An
inter-comparison
between
SLP
and
U
10
originating
from
the
popular
ERA40
(
2.5
°
∗
2.5
°
/
6
h
)
and
the
NCEP/NCAR
(
1.875
°
∗
1.875
°
/
6
h
)
reanalyzes
was
also
performed
over
the
period
of
ERA40
(
1958
–
2001
)
.
For
each
year
,
the
root
mean
square
of
the
difference
(
hereafter
RMSD
)
between
modeled
(
20CR
,
NCEP/NCAR
and
ERA40
)
and
observed
(
VOS
)
SLP
and
U
10
was
performed
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
(
70
°
W
–
0
°
W
and
20
°
N
–
70
°
N
,
Fig.
1
)
.
This
area
includes
a
large
density
of
observations
,
ranging
from
a
few
tens
per
year
in
the
late
19th
century
to
several
hundreds
of
thousands
for
the
last
6
decades
.
In
order
to
tentatively
explain
these
trends
,
Pearson
correlation
coefficients
were
computed
between
the
yearly-mean
station-based
NAO
index
(
Hurrell
,
1995
)
and
yearly-mean
H
s
(
Fig.
4
C
)
.
These
correlation
maps
reveal
a
significant
(
at
more
than
95
%
)
and
large
positive
correlation
area
to
the
North-East
of
the
study
area
,
with
correlation
coefficients
exceeding
0.5
.
A
significant
negative
correlation
area
develops
between
30
°
and
40
°
N
,
with
correlation
coefficients
reaching
−
0.5
.
Finally
,
a
last
significant
and
weakly
positive
correlation
area
developed
to
the
South-East
of
the
study
area
,
with
correlation
coefficients
reaching
0.3
.
To
distinguish
between
linear
trends
and
inter-annual
variability
driven
by
the
NAO
,
a
decomposition
in
Empirical
Orthogonal
Functions
(
hereafter
EOFs
;
Preisendorfer
,
1988
)
of
yearly-mean
time
series
of
H
s
was
performed
(
Fig.
5
)
.
This
analysis
shows
that
the
1st
mode
of
decomposition
explains
74
%
of
the
total
variance
of
yearly-mean
H
s
.
The
corresponding
spatial
pattern
of
this
mode
(
Fig.
5
A
)
matches
closely
that
of
the
linear
trends
of
Fig.
4
B
.
The
time-series
of
the
first
EOF
confirms
that
this
mode
corresponds
to
the
increase
in
H
s
over
the
studied
period
.
In
details
,
the
increase
is
strong
during
a
first
period
from
1900
to
1960
,
followed
by
a
second
period
from
1960
to
2008
where
the
increase
is
much
weaker
.
The
second
mode
of
decomposition
(
Fig.
5
B
)
explains
9
%
of
the
total
variance
of
yearly-mean
H
S
and
the
associated
spatial
pattern
strongly
matches
that
of
the
correlation
map
between
yearly-mean
H
s
and
NAO
index
(
Fig.
4
C
)
.
This
agreement
is
confirmed
by
the
associated
time-series
,
which
is
well
correlated
with
the
yearly-mean
NAO
index
(
R
2
=
0.73
,
Fig.
5
B
)
although
the
correlation
drops
between
1920
and
1930
.
In
order
to
better
quantify
this
behavior
,
Pearson
correlation
coefficients
were
computed
over
a
10
year
sliding
window
,
which
reveals
that
correlation
coefficients
range
from
0.6
to
0.9
over
the
whole
period
and
drop
to
0.45
from
1920
to
1930
.

Discussion
and
conclusions
4.1
.
Significance
of
the
trends
This
study
relies
on
a
new
numerical
wave
hindcast
,
driven
by
wind
fields
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
starting
in
1900
.
A
validation
of
wave
predictions
after
1955
was
undertaken
based
on
VOS
and
revealed
that
errors
for
yearly-mean
H
s
were
of
the
order
of
5
%
.
A
similar
direct
validation
prior
to
1950
was
not
possible
since
,
according
to
the
author
's
knowledge
,
wave
measurements
or
consistent
observation
is
insufficiently
available
.
This
difficulty
questions
the
reliability
of
our
results
for
the
period
1900
–
1955
,
although
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
shown
to
be
homogeneous
for
the
North
Atlantic
over
the
20th
century
(
Wang
et
al.
,
in
press
)
.
Alternatively
,
U
10
originating
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
was
compared
against
measurements
from
VOS
,
which
revealed
that
errors
on
this
parameter
only
increased
by
10
%
for
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
.
Nevertheless
,
the
values
of
RMSD
for
U
10
(
around
3.5
m.s
−
1
)
are
50
%
larger
compared
to
the
values
usually
obtained
when
comparing
atmospheric
reanalysis
with
buoys
(
e.g.
Chawla
et
al.
,
in
press
)
or
satellite
scatterometer
(
e.g.
Dee
et
al.
,
2011
and
Durrant
et
al.
,
2013
)
.
In
addition
to
the
probably
weaker
quality
of
VOS
data
compared
to
buoy
modern
measurements
or
scaterrometers
,
this
difference
may
originate
from
the
interpolations
in
space
(
the
three
atmospheric
reanalyzes
have
spatial
resolutions
of
the
order
of
2
°
)
and
in
time
(
3
-
to
6-hourly
data
)
associated
with
our
RMSD
computation
.
However
,
the
comparison
between
VOS
and
20CR
aimed
at
investigating
how
much
U
10
used
to
drive
our
wave
hindcast
deteriorates
over
the
studied
period
time
rather
than
providing
an
absolute
validation
of
the
20CR
reanalysis
.
It
is
accepted
that
the
dependence
of
H
s
on
the
wind
speed
U
obeys
a
relationship
of
the
form
H
s
≈
U
β
,
where
β
is
a
coefficient
varying
between
1
for
short-fetch
limited
conditions
and
2
for
fully
developed
seas
(
Ardhuin
et
al.
,
2007
and
Janssen
,
2008
)
.
In
this
study
,
the
~
10
%
larger
errors
in
wind
speed
for
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century
would
increase
the
NRMSE
in
H
s
from
5
%
for
the
period
1950
–
2008
to
6
%
for
the
period
1900
–
1950
.
Consequently
,
the
20
to
40
%
increases
in
H
s
that
we
demonstrated
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
still
hold
robustly
.
4.2
.
Comparison
with
previous
studies
Several
studies
have
already
reported
increases
in
H
s
in
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
(
Bacon
and
Carter
,
1991
,
Wang
and
Swail
,
2001
,
Dodet
et
al.
,
2010
and
Le
Cozannet
et
al.
,
2011
)
over
the
last
decades
.
Nevertheless
,
the
inter-annual
variability
of
H
s
at
northern
latitudes
was
shown
to
be
partly
controlled
by
the
NAO
and
the
reported
upward
trends
in
H
s
were
to
some
extend
explained
by
a
strong
increase
in
the
NAO
index
over
the
last
6
decades
(
Woolf
et
al.
,
2002
and
Dodet
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
this
study
,
a
significant
and
positive
correlation
between
H
s
and
the
NAO
index
was
also
identified
in
the
North-East
Atlantic
Ocean
,
although
weaker
than
in
Dodet
et
al.
(
2010
)
who
used
winter-mean
parameters
.
Unlike
previous
studies
focused
on
the
last
5
to
6
decades
,
the
NAO
index
does
not
experience
any
significant
trend
over
the
period
1900
–
2008
.
This
implies
that
the
large
increase
in
H
s
(
up
to
more
than
40
%
)
demonstrated
over
the
whole
North
Atlantic
Ocean
can
not
be
explained
by
the
NAO
.
Our
interpretation
is
that
a
long-term
upward
trend
is
superimposed
on
the
partly
NAO-controlled
inter-annual
variability
of
H
s
.
This
hypothesis
is
corroborated
by
the
EOF
analysis
,
which
shows
that
the
dominant
mode
is
clearly
correlated
with
the
spatial
and
temporal
variations
of
the
upward
trend
(
Fig.
5
A
)
.
The
spatial
patterns
and
the
magnitude
of
our
trends
differ
from
those
of
Wang
et
al.
(
2012
)
,
who
statistically
reconstructed
H
s
over
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
for
the
period
1871
–
2010
based
on
SLP
originating
from
20CR
.
Nevertheless
,
their
study
investigates
a
different
period
of
time
and
different
wave
parameters
(
seasonal
means
and
maximum
)
,
which
turns
delicate
the
comparison
with
our
study
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
order
of
magnitude
of
the
upward
trends
we
found
in
the
North
Atlantic
Ocean
matches
the
findings
of
other
studies
in
other
region
of
the
world
's
ocean
.
Thus
,
Reguero
et
al.
(
2013
)
performed
a
wave
numerical
hindcast
around
Latin
America
based
on
NCEP/NCAR
U
10
and
found
trends
reaching
locally
0.01
m.yr
−
1
for
the
period
1948
–
2012
.
In
the
North-East
Pacific
Ocean
,
Ruggiero
et
al.
(
2010
)
used
wave
buoy
measurements
and
found
a
0.015
m.yr
−
1
increase
for
the
yearly-mean
H
s
over
the
last
35
years
.
This
value
is
corroborated
by
the
findings
of
Gulev
and
Grigorieva
(
2004
)
who
found
a
0.01
m.yr
−
1
increase
in
this
region
using
VOS
over
the
period
1900
–
2002
.
4.3
.
Causes
for
H
s
increase
Wind
speed
from
the
20CR
reanalysis
showed
an
8
±
2
%
increase
in
the
North-East
Atlantic
Ocean
(
validation
NEA
,
Fig.

)
over
the
period
1900
–
2008
(
~
0.07
%
.
yr
−
1
)
.
This
upward
trend
is
partly
corroborated
by
VOS
,
which
showed
a
13
±
2
%
increase
over
the
period
1904
–
2010
(
~
0.1
%
.
yr
−
1
,
Fig.

)
.
Over
the
shorter
period
1948
–
2010
,
wind
speed
from
NCEP/NCAR
also
shows
a
7
±
1
%
increase
(
~
0.1
%
.
yr
−
1
)
.
