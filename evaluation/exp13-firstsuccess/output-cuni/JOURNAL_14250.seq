Abstract
In

which
were
subsequently
ejected

A
total
of
94
siliceous

thus
expelled
from
the

Similar
siliceous

were
often
found
in
the
extracapsulum
of
many
pylonioid

,
suggesting
they
did
also
secret

.
Pylonioids
may
silicify
continuously
,
and
the
normal
growth

of
the
siliceous

is
maintained
by
the
disposal
activity
of
excess
silification

Introduction
silicification
models
have
been
proposed

The
physical
model
of
Thompson
(
1942
)
is
the
best
known
amongst
them
;
it
interprets
Silicification
processes
of

)

Krabber

)
have
been
discussed
and
hypothesized
for
more
than
a
century
(
e.g.
,
Haeckel
,
1862
)
.
Since
the
development
of
the
geometrical
sym

in
radiolarians
was
discerned
by

the
tetrapod

form
of
the
polycystine
genus
Callimitra
as
being
formed
following
the
same
physical
process
as
the
for
-
mation
of
soap
bubbles
in
froth
.
This
model
has
been
widely
cited
in
scientific
books
;
however
,
the
observation
of
cytoplas
-
mic
structure
using
transmission
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
revealed
that
the
siliceous
matter
of
polycystines
is
deposited
inside
a
silica
deposition
vacuole
(
SDV
)
that
was
formed
with
a
functional
membrane
,
silicalemma
(
Anderson
,
1994
)
.
The
for
-
mation
process
of
polycystine
skeletons
is
currently
understood
following
examination
of
the
skeletons
in
various
growth
stages

and

(
Hurd
and
Theyer
,

;

)
.
Although
several
flat-shaped
polycystines
,
like
Dictyocoryne
truncatum
,
appear
to
have
grown
during
lab
-
oratory
culture
(
e.g.
,
Matsuoka
and
Anderson
,
1992
)
,
no
direct
documentation
of
the
formation
of
skeletons
exists
as
yet
for
polycystines
with
the
exception
of
Anderson
(
1983
:
p.
127
)
who
gave
a
brief
account
of
light
microscopic
observations
of
the
spine
growth
in
a
living
radiolarian
.
In
order
to
directly
observe
the
skeletogenesis
of
living
polycystines
,
we
participated
in
November
2009
in
the
11th
Radiolarian
Observation
Tour
of
Living
Radiolarians
at
Sesoko
Island
,
hosted
by
Atsushi
Matsuoka
(
Niigata
University
)
.
In
this
tour
,
we
continuously
observed
the
behavior
of
sev
-
eral
radiolarian
cells
in
f/2
culture
medium
(
a
widely
used
seawater
medium
designed
for
growing
coastal
marine
orga
-
nisms
)
with
the
addition
of
dissolved
silica
(
final
concentration
10
lj
,
M
)
.
During
our
3-day
culturing
experiment
,
a
polycystine
radiolarian
species
,
Streblacantha
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jeirgensen
)
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
,
appeared
to
undergo
skeletogene
-
sis
where
siliceous
particles
abruptly
appeared
.
Many
siliceous
particles
were
formed
during
our
session
of
observation
,
which
were
subsequently
expelled
from
the
cell
through
the
tip
of
elon
-
gated
pseudopodia
.
This
behavior
,
documented
in
this
paper
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
,
was
so
slow
that
we
needed
a
10x
-
speed
video
movie
(
real
60
min
were
converted
to
6
min
)
to
fully
capture
it
.
We
examined
how
many
siliceous
fragments
were
ejected
,
whether
they
were
newly
formed
or
whether
they
simply
originated
from
the
breakage
of
siliceous
portions
of
the
skeleton
,
we
also
examined
whether
the
behavior
of
the
cell
was
related
to
the
formation
of
the
siliceous
fragments
.

.
The
polycystine
cells
were
isolated
under
an
inverted
microscope
and
binocular
stereo
microscope
with
a
Pasteur
pipette
,
and
were
transferred
into
a
chamber
of
a

plate
with
16mL
of
0.4
S

,
m
,
filtered
seawater
emended
with
f/2
culture
medium
and
silicate
ion
(
tinal
concentration
:

)
.
A
total
of
10
cells
of
different
species
were
incubated
together
in
the
same
culture
chamber
of
a
cell
culture
plate
to
compare
them
under
the
same
conditions
from
November
2Sth
to
Nov
27th
,
2009
.
Of
these
radiolarians
,
a
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jeirgensen
)
was
recorded
with
a
Hi-Vision

attached
to
an

.
The
total
of
nearly

time
was
close
to
23
h
from
November
26th
to
Nov
27th

(

.
Because
its
motility
was
too
slow
to
be
recognized
in
a
video
at
the
normal
speed
,
the
recorded
video
data
was
con
-
verted
to
a
10x-speed

movie
(

using
a

.
The
PDMPO-experiment
introduced
in
this
paper
was
realized
a
year
before
,
November
25th
,
2008
,
during
the
10th
Radiolarian
Observation
Tour
(
hosted
by
Matsuoka
Atsushi
)
.
PDMPO
is
an
acronym
of
a
fluorescent
compound
that
accumulates
in
acidic
cell
compartments
,

-
(
4-pyridyl
)

oxazole
(
PDMPO
)
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
PDMPO
is
accu
-
mulated
with
silica
under
acidic
conditions
,
and
the
newly
developed
silica
skeletons
display
a
green
fluorescent
light
.
The
picked
cells
were
put
into
a
glass
tube
with
16
mL
of
seawater
filtered
with
a
0.45
p
,
m
membrane
filter
.
The
PDMPO
(
final
concentration
:
1.0
p.M
)
was
dissolved
in
20mL
of
percolated
seawater
in
advance
,
and
then
added
into
the
glass
tube
with
polycystine
cells
.
These
tubes
were
incubated
under
red
and
blue
LED
lights
for
12
h
and
in
dark
for
12
h
at
26
'
C
.
After
the
incubation
,
the
samples
were
fixed
with
a
5
%
formalin
solution
.
The
fixed
materials
were
kept
in
5
'
C
prior
to
observation
.
To
observe
the
stained
condition
with
PDMPO
,
the
material
was
dropped
on
a
glass
slide
and
covered
with
a
cover
glass
.
Four
lines
of
vaseline
were
spread
on
each
side
of
the
cover
glass
to
prevent
it
from
crushing
the
radiolarian
specimen
.
All
slides
were
observed
with
an
epifluorescence
microscope
(
AX-80
,
Olympus
)
with
UV-excitation
(
WU
:
BP330
â
€
”
38S
,
DM400
,
BA420
)
,
and
images
of
selected
cells
were
digitally
captured
with
a
CCD
camera
(
DXM-1200
,
Nikon
)
.
The
physiological
ecology
of
radiolarians
kept
in
a
labora
-
tory
without
natural
light
is
expressed
occasionally
with
some
specific
movements
,
which
may
be
related
to
daily
cycles
(
e.g.
,
Anderson
,
1983
:
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
However
,
additional
evi
-
dence
is
needed
to
understand
the
daily
cycle
in
radiolarians
.
As
the
cell
observed
in
this
experiment
appears
to
be
active
during
in
daytime
and
inactive
at
night
,
this
paper
will
denote
phys
-
iological
events
at
real
time
,
instead
of
elapsed
time
from
the
beginning
of
our
observation
.

Results
Ten
cells
of

for
3days
with
silica-supplemented
seawater
;
only
one
of
them
(
a
cell
of

and
then
ejected
them

It
can
he
noted
that
this
same
cell
of
this
species
looks
different
in
outline
of
the
skeleton
where
viewed
in
different
orientations
during
rotation
.
All
the
images
shown
Figs.
3
through
6
are
the
exactly
same
cell
.
structure
hidden
behind
a
thick
,
opaque
cytoplasm
(
Figs.
3.1
â
€
”
3.9
)
.
As
shown
on
Fig.
3
,
the
cell
looks
very
different
,
depending
on
its
orientation
.
In
some
views
,
the
overall
shape
of
the
skeleton
appears
to
be
quadrate
(
Figs.
3.1
,
3.2
)
,
ellipsoidal
(
Figs.
3.4
,
3.5
)
,
oblong
(
Fig.
3.7
)
,
or
even
triangular
(
Fig.
3.8
)
.
A
girdle-like
pore
frame
was
also
recognized
(
e.g.
,
Fig.
3.9
)
.
Such
irregular
appearances
are
commonly
encountered
in
the
taxa
belonging
to
the
Superfamily
Pylonioidea
(
=
Pyloniacea
sensu
De
Wever
et
al.
,
2001
,
see
ICZN2000
)
.
However
,
no
apparent
gates
and
no
cupolas
related
to
pylonioid
girdles
are
present
in
it
,
suggesting
that
it
belongs
to
Terrapyle
,
Tholonittm
,
or
other
closely
related
genera
.
The
skeleton
of
the
cell
is
also
characterized
by
the
presence
of
larger
pores
.
Nearly
identical
morphotypes
to
our
cell
were
in
general
identified
as
Srreblacant/M
cipcumtexra
(
Jctrgensen
)
in
the
west
Pacific
(
e.g.
,
Chen
and
Tan
,
1996
)
.
The
type
specimens
illustrated
in
JI6rgensen
(
190S1
are
somewhat
different
from
our
cell
in
the
absence
of
long
stout
radial
spines
,
so
that
we
tentatively
identified
this
cell
as
S.
cf.
tircuntrexta
(
JIIrgensen
)
.
The
cytoplasm
of
the
cell
consists
of
a
brownish
red
intra
-
capsulum
and
whitish
translucent
extracapsulum
,
just
inside
the
siliceous
skeleton
(
Figs.
4.1
â
€
”
4.9
)
.
The
extracapsulum
inside
the
siliceous
test
appears
granular
,
with
granules
moving
slowly
inside
the
extracapsulum
throughout
the
session
of
observation
.
The
intracapsulum
is
spherical
in
shape
,
but
the
inner
brownish
red
endoplasm
changed
in
shape
between
spherical
and
ellipti
-
cal
.
The
translucent
extracapsulum
fully
enclosed
the
skeleton
in
the
early
hours
of
the
day
(
Figs.
3.1
,
3.2
,
4.1
â
€
”
4.5
)
but
shrunk
pro-
gressively
afterwards
(
Figs.
3.1
â
€
”
3.9
,
4.9
)
.
The
pseudopodia
of
the
cell
belong
to
three
different
types
,
described
here
for
the
first
time
:
high-contrast
,
very

,
solid
siliceous
fragments
of
10
to
30
p
,
m
in
size
were
found
adjacent
to
the
cell
during
the
obser
-
vation
days
.
A
total
of
94
fragments
were
recorded
on
the
digital
video
.
The
fragments
are
trifurcate
,
ramiform
or
plate-like
;
some
others
appear
to
be
part
of
a
pore-frame
.
More
fragments
might
have
existed
since
we
were
able
to
observe
the
cell
from
one
side
only
.
All
identitiable
siliceous
fragments
were
digitally
captured
and
numbered
in
sequence
(
Figs.
1
,
2
)
.
It
is
interesting
that
a
new
fragment
was
abruptly
observable
.
It
was
generally
difficult
for
us
to
eyewitness
the
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
.
The
upper
side
of
the
cell
easily
rotated
sideways
and
new
siliceous
fragments
were
generally
hidden
behind
the
cell
.
However
,
the
formation
process
of
a
fragment
(
fragment
ID
8
)
was
successfully
recorded
in
the
digital
video
(
Figs.
5.1
â
€
”
5.21
)
.
It
is
best
understood
by
winding
back
the
video
record
.
The
fragment
moved
out
of
a
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
around
09:26
AM
on
26th
,
Nov.
(
Figs.
5.20
,
5.21
)
.
The
fragment
was
first
recognizable
inside
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
around
09:25
AM
(
Figs.
5.15
â
€
”
5.19
)
.
Prior
to
this
time
,
no
distinguishable
outline
was
discernible
regardless
of
the
orientation
of
the
cell
(
Figs.
5.9
â
€
”
5.14
)
,
but
shadow
that
may
possibly
be
the
fragment
is
distinguishable
in
the
earlier
record
(
Figs.
5.6
â
€
”
5.8
)
.
Similar
phenomena
were
recorded
for
other
frag
-
ments
,
but
the
timing
of
the
start
of
the
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
was
not
precisely
determined
due
to
rotation
of
the
cell
during
the
observation
.
There
are
four
possible
sources
of
fragments
:
~
debris
in
the
cell
;
~
breakage
of
pieces
from
pre-existing
cell
skeleton
;
~
newly
formed
fragments
during
our
observation
session
;
~
captured
polycystines
as
prey
.
Since
the
cell
slowly
rotated
many
times
during
the
recor
-
ding
period
,
we
could
confirm
many
times
that
there
was
an
absence
of
fragments
.
This
rotation
also
allowed
us
to
compare
the
same
face
of
the
test
at
different
times
.
Several
fragments
look
like
a
portion
of
a
pore-frame
approximately
10
â
€
”
20
p
,
m
in
size
(
Fig.
4.7

,
but
as
the

S.
cf.
circumter

ta

much
larger
(
ca.
30
&

p
,

)
breakage
is
not
a
likely
source
of
frag
-
ments
.
The
addition
of
new
pore
frame
would
have
been
easily
recognized
if
it
happened
,
but
we
did
not
observe
it
.
It
is
unlikely
to
be
sourced
from
captured
polycystines
as
prey
because
we
have
never
encountered
captured
polycystines
by
other
poly
-
cystines
in
our
observed
thousands
living
specimens
during
our
tifteen

experience

The
most
important
discovery
in
this
observation
is
the
dis
-
posal
activity
of
siliceous
fragments
(
Appendix

)
.
The
sequential
record
of
each
fragment
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
disposal
movement
is
shown
in
the
B
column
of
Figs.
1
and
2
.
In
most
cases
the
disposal
movement
occurred
in
clusters
of
several
siliceous
fragments
after
the
spontaneous
extension
of
both
HCT
and

.
The
siliceous
fragments
were
always
disposed
by
movement
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
A
siliceous
fragment
moved
outside
by
elon

gation
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
,
or
moved
occasionally
forward
or
backward
from
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
.
Once
a
fragment
apparently
moved
outside
,
this
fragment
was
never
withdrawn
back
to
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
.
The
frag

ment
in
this
condition
was
generally
attached
to
the
distal
end
of
tens
of
LCT
pseudopodia
(

.

Discussion
One
may
wonder
whether
observation
made
in
the
laboratory
correspond
to
normal
cell
behaviour
.
This
question
may
not
have
been
addressed
adequately
in
this
study
.
However
,
in
spite
of
this
uncertainty
,
we
believe
it
is
worthwhile
reporting
and
discussing
it
because
this
is
the
first
direct
observation
of
a
polycystine
forming
silicified
fragments
.
4.1
.
Slow
silicification
of
polycystines
This
culture
experiment
was
initially
planned
to
encourage
silicification
by
adding
dissolved
silica
;
we
had
initially
planned
to
verify
newly
silicified
parts
with
a
fluorescent
compound
,
PDMPO
(
for
a
detailed
description
of
the
method
see
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
,
2010
)
.
In
spite
of
numerous
efforts
made
by
radiolar
-
workers
to
observe
living
polycystines
,
nobody
has
directly
observed
skeleton
formation
with
the
exception
of
Anderson
(
1983
:
p.
127
)
.
Three
possibilities
may
explain
this
:
~
polycystine
cells
die
within
a
few
days
during
laboratory
culture
(
e.g.
,
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
)
;
~
they
can
not
form
a
skeleton
because
of
shortage
of
dissolved
silica
in
natural
sea
water
;
~
skeletogenesis
is
a
very
slow
process
.
The
cytological
behavior
of
polycystines
is
commonly
slow
or
nearly
static
except
for
very
occasional
abrupt
movements
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
;
Suzuki
,
2005
;
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
Thus
,
long-term
continuous
observations
of
a
single
cell
with
a
video
recorder
are
essential
to
study
their
physiological
ecology
.
During
200-times
fast
screening
observation
(
60
min
=
18
s
;
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
of
our
recording
of
the
radiolarian
behav
-
ior
we
realized
that
the
siliceous
fragments
formation
is
an
extremely
slow
process
(
the
film
attached
is
18s
and
it
cor
-
responds
to
an
1
h
in
reality
)
.
The
formation
model
of
siliceous
skeletons
consists
of
primary
growth
(
PG
)
,
secondary
growth
(
SG
)
and
skeletal
thickening
growth
(
STG
)
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
PG
forms
the
principal
framework
of
skeletons
and
SG
is
the
for
-
mation
of
a
new
siliceous
part
on
the
already
existing
skeleton
(
Anderson
and
Bennett
,
1985
)
.
STG
thickens
the
already
exist
-
ing
skeletons
but
never
forms
a
new
skeleton
part
like
PG
and
SG
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
We
conclude
that
the
silicification
by
S.
cf.
circumtexta
reported
in
this
paper
is
a
kind
of
SG
.
ian
4.2
.
Patchwork
silicification
and
disposal
activity
Our
conclusion
about
patchwork
silicification
is
inferred
based
on
our
observation
of
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
.
It
is
unlikely
that
these
siliceous
fragments
originated
from
pre-existing
broken
particles
around/on
the
cell
,
because
the
cell
expelled
at
least
94
fragments
.
If
these
94
fragments
were

Two
points
need

the

and
other
observational
data
about
the

we
found
that
cells
belonging
to
the
Superfamily
Pylonioidea
are
commonly
associated
with
siliceous
fragments
in
their
extracapsulum
(
Fi
s.

.
Similar
siliceous
frag
-
ments
are
also
found
in
a
fiat-shaped
polycystine
(

.
There
is
no
evidence
about
the
origin
of
the
siliceous
fragments
in
these
cells
,
hut
we
have
commonly
observed
in
laboratory
that
the
pylonioids
with
HCT
pseudopodia
hold
siliceous
frag
-
ments
.
Furthermore
,
it
is
noted
that
almost
all
the
siliceous
fragments
are
always
located
inside
the
HCT
pseudopodial
tV

This
observation
suggests
that
pylonioids
possessing
HCT
pseudopodia
can
form
siliceous
fragments
as
a
normal
process
of
silicification
.
We
speculate
that
this
energy-wasting
behaviour
is
related
to
a
difference
of
silicification
patterns
among
polycystines
.
Ogane
et
al.
(
20101
pointed
out
that
the
siliciftcation
process
of
some
polycystines
is
an
intermittent
process
.
By
contrast
,
our
cell
,
S.
cf.
circumtevta
,
showed
non
-
stop
silicification
,
while
the
other
three
non-pylonioid
species
incubated
with
S.
cf.
circumtevta
(
Didymocvrtis
tetrathalamus
tetrathalamus
,
Spongaster
tetras
tetras
and
Haliommilla
capil
-
laceum
)
are
known
to
exhibit
intermittent
growth
patterns
(
Matsuoka
and
Anderson
,
1992
:
Sugiyama
and
Anderson
,
1997
;
Ogane
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
These
specimens
survived
for
3
days
with
S.
cf.
circ
umte
~
ta
in
the
same
chamber
of
the
cell
culture
plate
,
but
no
growth
of
any
kind
was
observed
.
The
polycystines
with
non-stop
silicification
like
Pylonioidea
do
patchwork
silicifi
-
cation
and
disposal
activity
so
as
not
to
become
overgrown
,
differing
from
the
species
with
intermittent
growth
.
The
normal
condition
in
seawater
is
very
low
concentra
-
tions
of
dissolved
silica
(
Siedler
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
Silicification
requires
a
source
of
energy
to
concentrate
and
solidify
this
highly
dilute
chemical
substance
from
a
dissolved
state
(
e.g.
,
Schroeder
,
1999
)
.
This
raises
the
question
on
the
adaptive
value
of
apparently
regulating
"
excessive
silica
deposition
"
by
secret
-
ing
large
fragments
and
expelling
them
.
It
may
be
difficult
to
explain
that
this
phenomenon
is
a
control
mechanism
for
over
-
siliciftcation
,
given
the
very
dilute
quantities
of
silica
in
seawater
,
because
organisms
would
be
better
off
simply
to
stop
accumu
-
lating
more
silica
if
it
was
in
excess
.
These
processes
are
usually
tightly
controlled
biologically
,
and
normally
remain
active
only
enough
to
complete
the
biomineralized
shell
or
skeleton
.
This
phenomenon
,
as
observed
in
S.
cf.
tircuttttevta
and
other
pylo
-
nioids
,
would
be
a
remarkably
non-adaptive
way
for
a
living
organism
to
control
biomineralization
.
It
may
be
a
genetic
abnor
-
mality
that
has
mutated
to
turn
on
a
silicification
process
in
the
extracapsulum
that
has
become
uncontrolled
.
There
are
some
similar
examples
of
genetic
errors
in
humans
,
such
as
the
uncon
-
trolled
deposition
of
honey
deposits
in
the
skin
and
soft
tissues
of
the
body
(
osteoma
cutis
)
.
This
is
undoubtedly
a
genetic
anomaly
leading
to
what
we
would
call
in
humans
an
in-born
error
of
metabolism
.
The
evolutionary
origin
of
non-stop
silification
in
the
pylonioids
with
HCT
pseudopodia
ought
to
shed
light
on
the
causes
of
diversification
of
pylonioids
since
the
Paleocene
(
De
Wever
et
al.
.
2001

Futtctiott
of
cvtoplasm
Various
physiological
functions
of
the
cytoplasm
have
been
studied
in
Collodaria
,
Spumellaria
and
Nassellaria
(
Anderson
,
1983
:
Matsuoka
,
2007
:
Sugiyama
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
We
have
recog
-
nized
a
new
silicification
function
in
the
extracapsulum
based
on
our
supplemented
silica
experiment
with
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(

)
,
and

of
Pylo

(
Figs.
7.1
,

)
.
The
cytoplasmic
structure
with
a
silicification
function
is
called
the
silicalemma
(
Anderson
,
1994
)
.
The
cell
examined
in
our
experiment
has
three
types
of
pseudopodia
,
namely
HCT
pseudopodia
,
LCT
pseudopodia
and
an
axoflagellum
.
HCT
pseudopodia
have
always
a
strong
adhe
-
sive
function
and
they
frequently
adhere
to
the
bottom
of
the
culture
chamber
.
This
adhesive
function
of
HCT
pseudopodia
helped
us
to
observe
the
specimen
continuously
for
23-hours
because
the
cell
did
not
move
in
the
culture
chamber
most
of
time
.
This
adhesive
function
of
HCT
pseudopodia
is
only
effected
for
a
limited
time
,
because
the
cell
occasionally
sepa
-
rated
from
the
bottom
and
floated
in
the
sea
water
of
the
culture
chamber
.
LCT
pseudopodia
were
used
to
expel
siliceous
frag
-
ments
.
When
LCT
pseudopodia
started
to
throw
a
siliceous
fragment
away
,
a
single
LCT
pseudopodium
or
a
few
LCT
pseudopodia
elongated
distally
with
the
siliceous
fragment
attached
on
the
tip
of
these
LCT
pseudopodia
.
The
siliceous
fragment
abruptly
detached
and
sank
down
without
any
rota
-
tion
of
the
siliceous
fragment
.
The
siliceous
fragment
simply
detached
from
the
adhesive
tip
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
or
was
discarded
with
a
small
portion
of
the
cytoplasm
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
Only
the
tip
of
LCT
pseudopodia
is
adhesive
.
We
do
not
recognize
adhesive
function
in
all
the
other
parts
of
LCT
pseudopodia
except
for
its
tip
.
This
means
that
the
polycystine
can
control
the
adhesive
condition
in
different
portions
along
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
function
of
the
axoflagellum
is
still
unknown
.
Several
previous
papers
contain
comments
on
the
function
of
pseudopodia
to
support
a
planktonic
lifestyle
,
the
maintenance
of
buoyancy
,
the
sudden
contraction
against
attack
,
and
enhance
-
ment
of
protoplasmic
streaming
inside
the
endoplasm
in
solitary
spherical
polycystines
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
;
Suzuki
,
200S
:
Matsuoka
,
2007
)
.
The
functions
of
capturing
and
securing
a
prey
are
also
known
to
be
mediated
by
pseudopodia
in
both
Nassellaria
(
Sugiyama
et
al.
,
2008
)
and
solitary
spherical
poly
-
cystines
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
)
.
Pseudopodial
behavior
during
predation
,
sudden
contraction
against
attack
,
enhance
-
ment
of
protoplasmic
streaming
and
other
functions
could
be
explained
by
a
mechanical
response
to
simple
tactile
stimulation
.
However
,
the
pseudopodia
of
S.
cf.
circumtevta
did
not
react
to
our
attempts
at
artiftcial
mechanical
stimulation
such
as
tapping
the
culture
plate
.
Although
the
exact
mode
of
radiolarian
pseu
-
dopodial
sensation
and
response
is
unknown
,
it
is
clear
that
the
cell
controls
complex
pseudopodial
activity
such
as
the
intricate
behavior
documented
here
in
our
research
.

Conclusions
A
single
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumte
~
ta
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
formed
at
least
94
siliceous
fragments
inside
the
extracapsulum
as
a
kind
of
SG
mode
.
After
residing
inside
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
,
they
moved
outside
of
the
HCT
pseudopodia
by
the
elongation
of
a
few
LCT
pseudopodia
and
then
were
ejected
to
fall
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
culture
chamber
.
These
movements
were
documented
via
a
movie
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
I
)
.
Pseudopodia
are
very
important
organelles
to
sustain
sur
-
vival
.
They
are
divided
here
,
for
the
first
time
,
into
two
types
,
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
.
HCT
pseudopodia
are
named
due
to
their
high-contrast
thick
form
,
and
are
generally
shorter
