Comparison of ice-rafted debris and physical properties in ODP Site 1094 (South Atlantic) with the Vostok ice core over the last four climatic cycles Abstract Visual counts of ice-rafted debris (IRD), foraminifera, and radiolaria were made for ∼1500 samples in Site 1094 spanning the last four climatic cycles (marine isotope stages 1–11). Most, but not all, of the IRD variability is captured by whole-core physical properties including magnetic susceptibility and γ-ray attenuation bulk density. Glacial periods are marked by high IRD abundance and millennial-scale variability, which may reflect instability of ice shelves in the Weddell Sea region. Each interglacial period exhibits low IRD and high foraminiferal abundance during the early part of the interglacial, indicating relatively warm sea-surface temperatures and reduced influence of sea ice. IRD increases and foraminiferal abundances decrease during the latter part of each interglacial, indicating a return to more glacial-like conditions. Glacial terminations I and V are each characterized by a step-wise reduction in ice-rafting punctuated by a brief pulse in IRD delivery and reversal in δ 18 O. The coarse fraction of the sediment is dominated by ash and radiolaria, and the relative abundance of these components is remarkably similar to the concentration of Na + in Vostok. Each of these variables is believed to be controlled mainly by sea-ice cover, thereby providing a means for sediment–ice core correlation.

Introduction There is much interest and speculation about how stable the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has been in the past, what factors control its stability, and how the AIS will respond to anthropogenic greenhouse warming in the future ( Alley and Whillans, 1991 , MacAyeal, 1992 , Bindschadler, 1998 , Bindschadler et al., 1998 and Scherer et al., 1998 ). Because much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is grounded below sea level, it is the most susceptible to perturbations in sea level and climate ( Denton et al., 1986 , Anderson and Thomas, 1991 and Bindschadler, 1998 ). Here we studied downcore changes in concentration of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) at Site 1094 in the southeast Atlantic to decipher the history of two different components of the cryosphere: ice sheets discharging into the Weddell Sea region of Antarctica ( Kanfoush et al., 2000 ) and sea ice ( Fig. 1 ). The AIS expanded at the Last Glacial Maximum, with most of the change concentrated in West Antarctica ( Bindschadler, 1998 ). The WAIS was about two-thirds larger than today and grounded ice shelves in marginal seas around Antarctica extended to sea level which was ∼120 m lower than today. Kanfoush et al. (2000) documented millennial-scale pulses in IRD delivery to the South Atlantic during the last glaciation that represent episodes of instability of grounded ice shelves in the Weddell Sea on suborbital timescales. Variability of IRD has also been documented for the Holocene from the South Atlantic including an abrupt late-Holocene increase in ice-rafting and decrease in sea-surface temperatures (SST) at ∼5.5 ka ( Hodell et al., 2001 ). In this study, we extend the high-resolution record of ice-rafting at Site 1094 from marine isotopic stage (MIS) 1 through 11 in order to examine the nature of ice-sheet and sea-ice variability over the last four climatic cycles. The longest, most continuous record of Antarctic climate variability is the Vostok ice core, which extends through the last 420 kyr and captures variability on millennial timescales ( Petit et al., 1999 ). Here we present a South Atlantic deep-sea record that has a length equaling and resolution approaching, or in some intervals exceeding, that of the Vostok ice core. The utility of such a record is twofold. First, a high-resolution IRD record spanning several climatic cycles provides an opportunity to understand the interactions between variability in the suborbital and Milankovitch bands. Second, correlation of the marine-sediment and ice-core records will enable comparison of the timing and magnitude of IRD variability in the South Atlantic with changes in atmospheric variables recorded in Vostok. Our study is similar to that of Bond et al. (1993) who presented a correlation between North Atlantic cores and the Greenland ice cores which revealed the relationship between IRD events (Heinrich events – Heinrich, 1988 ) and temperature changes over Greenland during the last glaciation (Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles – Dansgaard et al., 1993 ). Similarly, correlation of the high-resolution South Atlantic IRD record from Site 1094 will help determine if Antarctic ice-discharge events were linked to external climatic factors. 2. Materials and methods The material analyzed in this study comes from a 14-m piston core (TTN057-13-PC4) taken at 53.2°S 05.1°E in 2850 m of water depth and ODP Site 1094 taken at the same location in 2818 m of water depth each in a small sedimentary basin near Bouvet Island ( Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999 ). The site is located in the biogenic silica belt of the Southern Ocean south of the present-day position of the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and about 2° north of the average limit of winter sea ice ( Zwally et al., 1983 and Gloerson et al., 1993 ). The piston core was sampled at 3- or 5-cm intervals, corresponding to a temporal resolution of approximately 50–150 years during the interglacial periods and approximately 300–500 years during the glacial periods. In order to extend the record through the last four climatic cycles, the piston core was spliced to ODP Core 1094C-2. This core then was appended to the shipboard-generated composite record that was produced from the same site (Site 1094) during Leg 177 ( Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999 ). The ODP cores were sampled at 5-cm intervals, yielding similar temporal resolution to that of the piston core. Ten AMS 14 C dates on monospecific samples of Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sin.) from nine stratigraphic horizons in TTN057-13 provide chronological control to a depth of 9.7 m below seafloor (mbsf) (to ∼38 kyr; explained in Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). All ages presented subsequently are in calendar years. Using planktonic foraminiferal oxygen isotopic records, TTN057-13-PC4 and 1094C were spliced at a depth of 9.7 mbsf in the piston core and depths in the piston core were adjusted downward by 3 m ( Table 1 ). This is equivalent to a depth of 12.7 m composite depth (mcd) in Core 1094C-2, which is not part of the shipboard splice. The downward adjustment of depths in the piston core is necessary to produce a record that is consistent with the depth assignments (i.e., mcd) in ODP site 1094. To the base of 1094C (at 20.5 mcd), the 1094 composite was then spliced extending the record to 73.7 mcd. Below the TTN057-13-PC4/1094C splice position (12.7 mcd), the chronology is constructed by correlating the oxygen isotopic record to SPECMAP ( Imbrie et al., 1984 and Martinson et al., 1987 ) and intervening ages were interpolated assuming linear sedimentation rates between tie points ( Fig. 2 ). Downcore IRD concentrations were visually determined on the 150-μm–2-mm size fraction ( Allen and Warnke, 1991 ). At least 500 grains were counted and included quartz, volcanic ash, fine-grained volcanics, coarse-crystalline rock fragments, metamorphics, radiolarians and foraminifera. Relative percent within the 150-μm fraction (%), number of grains/g of total dry sediment, mg/g of total dry sediment and accumulation rate (mg/cm 2 /kyr) were calculated for the individual components ( Allen and Warnke, 1991 ). Abundance of planktonic foraminifera at Site 1094 was variable, resulting in a discontinuous oxygen isotope record, including a gap in late stage 11 and 10 and also in mid stage 5. Oxygen isotopic measurements of the planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sin.) were made at the University of Florida using a Finnigan MAT252 mass spectrometer coupled to an automated carbonate preparation system (Kiel III). Isotopic ratios are reported in standard δ notation (δ 18 O) relative to V-PDB ( Coplen, 1996 ). Analytical precision, estimated by the standard deviation (1σ) of repeated analyses of a powdered carbonate standard (NBS-19), was ±0.06‰ for δ 18 O. Shipboard measurements of magnetic susceptibility (MS) and γ-ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density were made at 2-cm sample intervals using a GEOTEK multisensor core logger on whole-core sections recovered from Site 1094 ( Weber et al., 1997 and Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999 ). These parameters were measured on both the piston core and the Leg 177 material. Consequently, MS and GRA bulk density data are from the identical composite stratigraphy utilized for IRD analysis. Natural γ-radiation (NGR) was collected only on Site 1094 cores, however, therefore the shipboard splice above 12.7 mcd was correlated to the piston core using oxygen isotope stratigraphy. Quantitative estimates of diffuse spectral reflectance were generated on split core sections at 4–6-cm sample intervals using the Oregon State University Split Core Analysis Track ( Mix et al., 1992 and Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999 ). 3. Results IRD at Site 1094 is composed predominantly of ash (88.3% of the lithic fraction and 600 grains/g on average) and quartz (10.9% and 50 grains/g on average) ( Fig. 3 ). The strong dominance of ash within the total lithic assemblage results in nearly identical records of ash and total lithics. Consequently, hereafter, only plots of quartz and total lithics are shown. IRD levels are generally high during the glacial periods (1200 grains/g on average) and low during the interglacial periods (300 grains/g on average) with a high degree of variability within each of these periods. Expressed as a relative percent of the coarse fraction, the total lithics were roughly equivalent during each of the four glacial periods (reaching >80% in each case). However, expressed as a concentration ( Fig. 4 ), peak values of the last glacial period (5000–10 000 grains/g) were considerably higher than those of MIS 6, 8 and 10 (2000–4000 grains/g). The whole-core sediment physical properties measurements, MS, NGR and GRA bulk density, are each high during the glacial periods (averaging 38.1×10 −5 SI, 4.8 cps and 1.25 g/cm 3 , respectively) and low during the interglacials (averaging 10.2×10 −5 SI, 1.9 cps and 1.20 g/cm 3 ) ( Fig. 6 ). The highest levels (nearing 200×10 −5 SI, 11.5 cps and 1.5 g/cm 3 ) occurred during the last glacial period. Both MS and GRA bulk density exhibit a degree of variability within each marine isotopic stage similar to that of the visually determined IRD, capturing many of the prominent features displayed by that record. The NGR record exhibits a prominent saw-toothed pattern whereby values increase gradually throughout each glacial period and then decrease abruptly at glacial terminations. The percent reflectance record is low during glacial periods and high during interglacial periods, paralleling the δ 18 O record. It also exhibits a saw-toothed pattern, although the relationship is inverted relative to that of the NGR. The general saw-toothed structure displayed by both NGR and percent reflectance has numerous millennial-scale oscillations superimposed upon this pattern. 3.1. Glacial periods Throughout the last glacial period, discrete episodes of IRD deposition recur on millennial timescales (∼6–10 kyr; Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 ; Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). None lasts for more than a few thousand years, and the concentration typically returns to baseline values before increasing again. Peaks are composed predominantly of ash and quartz, with ash abundances roughly an order of magnitude greater than those of quartz (surpassing 5000 grains/g and 400 grains/g, respectively), and the two primary constituents closely parallel each other throughout. As in the IRD record of the last glacial period, MS and GRA bulk density also contain discrete peaks recurring on millennial timescales. Values of these whole-core physical properties generally do return to baseline values before increasing again but, unlike the IRD record, the baseline is substantially elevated above the values of the contiguous interglacial periods (MIS 5 and the Holocene). In all parameters, higher-frequency oscillations are also superimposed upon the ∼6–10-kyr events. Discrete peaks in IRD, dominantly ash and quartz, occurred during MIS 6, MIS 8 and MIS 10 with a temporal spacing (∼3–12, ∼2–9 and ∼2–8 kyr, respectively) similar to that observed for the last glacial period ( Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). Unlike the last glaciation, however, the magnitude of the IRD peak concentrations in the three older glaciations is smaller (∼2000–3000 grains/g, 3000–4000 grains/g and 1500–3000 grains/g). The records of MS and GRA bulk density do not parallel the IRD record as closely as they did in the records of the last glaciation. In both parameters, the peaks are often much greater than those found in the IRD record, particularly at ∼145–155 ka. As in the last glacial period, higher-frequency oscillations are superimposed upon the ∼3–12-kyr, ∼2–9-kyr and ∼2–8-kyr events displayed in all measured sediment parameters. 3.2. Interglacial periods Within each of the past five interglacial periods there is an early interval during which IRD values approach zero then rise abruptly. The early Holocene ( Fig. 4 and Fig. 7 ) is marked by a period in which foraminiferal abundances are high (>45%) and IRD is extremely low (∼5.4 grains/g on average). At ∼5.5 ka, percent IRD increases abruptly (to >60%). With the exception of two brief events (at ∼1500 and ∼600 yr BP), foraminiferal abundances accompanying this late-Holocene increase in IRD are very low (∼8.2%). Highest percent IRD occurs at ∼4.7 ka and there is a decrease in IRD following this although levels remain higher than those of the early Holocene. Expressed as a concentration, the large increase in IRD (to >140 grains/g) occurs later, beginning at ∼4 ka and peaking at ∼3 ka. Unlike the last glacial period, in which ash dominated IRD deposition at the site, the composition of the IRD in the late Holocene is dominantly quartz. MS, NGR and GRA bulk density are each low during the early Holocene (averaging 0.0×10 −5 SI, 1.2 cps and 1.150 g/cm 3 , respectively) and show an increase in the latter part of the Holocene (averaging 9.9×10 −5 SI, 3.2 cps and 1.163 g/cm 3 ). Similar to the record of foraminiferal abundances, high percent reflectance marks the early Holocene (27.5% on average) and is followed by lower percent reflectance values in the late Holocene (23.9% on average). Unlike the IRD and whole-core physical properties, the δ 18 O signal is relatively constant throughout the Holocene. The patterns of IRD and foraminiferal abundance during MIS 5 are similar to those observed for the Holocene. IRD values are near zero early in substage 5e (the Eemian) and increase to greater values at ∼120 ka. High foraminiferal abundances (>60%) in the early Eemian are replaced by generally lower foraminiferal abundances (<40%) throughout the remainder of the interglacial. MIS 5 is marked by large fluctuations in IRD abundances, with total lithics peaking at >80% and >1600 grains/g. High IRD and low foraminiferal abundances occur in substages 5d and 5b. A general reversal of these conditions occurs in substages 5c and 5a, although levels do not return to those observed in the early Eemian. The composition of the IRD in the latter part of MIS 5 is dominated by ash. As in the Holocene, MS, NGR and GRA bulk density during MIS 5 each increase (to ∼7×10 −5 SI, ∼6 cps and ∼1.18 g/cm 3 , respectively) following low Eemian values (∼−1×10 −5 SI, ∼0.5 cps and ∼1.19 g/cm 3 ). The opposite pattern (decreasing from >50% to ∼25%) is displayed by percent reflectance. MIS 7 shows two substages centered on ∼240 ka and ∼215 ka, of high foraminiferal abundances (>55% in each case) and essentially no IRD. As in MIS 5, the record is marked by periods of high IRD occurring during the stadials (>1500 grains/g in each case). Ash is the dominant component of the IRD throughout. From values approaching zero, MS reaches values of 95×10 −5 SI and 53×10 −5 SI during the stadials. Similarly, GRA bulk density values rise from ∼1.17 g/cm 3 to greater than 1.25 g/cm 3 during stadials; NGR values rise from <0 cps to >4 cps. From values greater than 30% during MIS 7, percent reflectance drops to less than 20% during stadials. Similar to MIS 7, two pronounced substages occur in MIS 9. Each is marked by an abrupt increase in IRD following intervals of low IRD. The earliest part of MIS 9 is essentially ‘IRD-free’. Unlike MIS 7, however, percent reflectance values remain relatively constant throughout, whereas MS and GRA bulk density increase from 20×10 −5 SI to >35×10 −5 SI and from about 1.23 to 1.3 g/cm 3 . The early part of MIS 11 was marked by a period of high foraminiferal abundances (>50%) and very little IRD. Although punctuated at ∼405 ka by a brief reversal in planktonic δ 18 O and a decline in foraminiferal abundances to near zero, IRD remains low throughout the early part of MIS 11. The planktonic δ 18 O minimum of MIS 11 remained heavier than those observed in MIS 9 and 5e (>2.9‰ versus <2.7 and ∼2.7‰, respectively). Ash is the dominant component of the IRD throughout MIS 11. From concentrations near zero in the earliest part of the stage, ash begins to gradually increase at ∼395 ka. Quartz displays an abrupt, large-magnitude (∼150 grains/g) peak at ∼383 ka. From a minimum of <0 cps at ∼407 ka, NGR values increase to 3.7 cps at ∼390 ka and from less than 25% at 405 ka, percent reflectance rapidly increases to >50% by 400 ka. MS begins at ∼395 ka to gradually increase from values approaching zero and reaches values of >15×10 −5 SI by the end of the interglacial period. Similarly, GRA bulk density values rise from <1.20 g/cm 3 to >1.25 g/cm 3 at ∼400 ka and continue to fluctuate near that value throughout the remainder of MIS 11. 3.3. Glacial terminations From high glacial concentrations, IRD decreases across each of the glacial terminations. This decrease occurs in a somewhat gradual ‘step-wise’ manner in some cases (terminations I, III and V) and abruptly in others (terminations II and IV). In all cases, however, the decrease in IRD occurs early during the termination. As δ 18 O values decline across termination I, they display a brief reversal toward heavier values before again declining ( Fig. 8 ). Within this δ 18 O reversal, there is a prominent IRD peak. Only termination V contains a similar IRD peak centered within a reversal in δ 18 O. The IRD peak within termination V is strongly dominated by quartz. 4. Discussion 4.1. Whole-core physical properties as proxies of IRD Analysis of IRD is a time-consuming procedure. Consequently, several researchers have sought, with success, to employ other sediment parameters as a proxy of IRD in North Atlantic sediments ( Robinson et al., 1995 , Stoner et al., 1995 , Stoner et al., 1996 and Chi and Mienert, 1996 ). An opportunity exists here to compare directly IRD concentrations with other sediment parameters in Site 1094 to assess their utility as IRD proxies in the South Atlantic. This also includes weight percent of the coarse sediment fraction (wt% >63 μm and wt% >150 μm), which is routinely measured during sample processing. In general, the glacial–interglacial pattern displayed by MS and GRA bulk density is similar to that for IRD ( Fig. 5 ). This implies these whole-core physical properties are controlled by terrigenous influx, largely via ice-rafting ( Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999 ). Discrepancies between the visually counted IRD and the whole-core physical properties may be attributed in part to grain-size differences resulting from the selected upper and lower sieve limits (2 mm and 150 μm, respectively) utilized for IRD analysis. Specifically, the substantially elevated glacial baseline values of the whole-core physical properties may reflect the presence of terrigenous fines omitted in the visual IRD cps. Examination of the weight percent of the various size fractions of the sediment supports this conclusion ( Fig. 9 ). Because of the greater weight of the lithics as compared to the biogenic components, the weight percent of the >150-μm fraction provides a good approximation of the IRD cps. However, inclusion of finer sediments (the weight percent 63–150–μm fraction) approaches more closely the structure of the MS and GRA bulk density records, specifically the elevated baseline of glacial periods ( Fig. 6 ). Both the start of glacial periods and glacial terminations are recorded as an abrupt change in the records of IRD, MS and GRA bulk density ( Fig. 5 ). Each of the past three glacial terminations is also abrupt in the records of δ 18 O, percent reflectance and NGR. However, the transition from interglacial to glacial conditions in these parameters is recorded as a gradual change. NGR is derived from decay of natural radioisotopes, including potassium, uranium and thorium, and reflects influx of terrigenous materials containing these radioisotopes. The strong anti-correlation between the prominent saw-toothed patterns of NGR and percent reflectance, therefore, implies that gradual decreases in percent reflectance result from either an increase in terrigenous influx or a decrease in biogenic input ( Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999 ). All other factors being equal, however, both processes would impact the other indicators of terrigenous influx as well. Their lack of anti-correlation with percent reflectance, therefore, implies that the NGR signal is dominated by fine-grained sediments delivered to the site via ice-rafting, focusing by deep currents, advection within the nephaloid layer and/or eolian transport. Alternatively, the NGR signal may reflect dilution by biosiliceous sediment (diatom productivity). Discrete IRD peaks observed within each of the past four glaciations begin and end abruptly and are very brief, on the order of a few thousand to even a few hundred years in duration. Even with the high sedimentation rates at Site 1094 (averaging ∼40 cm/yr and ∼18 cm/yr during interglacial and glacial periods, respectively), the ice-rafting events are recorded within only a few centimeters sediment thickness. This, in conjunction with slightly offset sampling depths and differing sampling intervals for the different sediment measurements, may explain discrepancies between the millennial-scale events present within the IRD and the whole-core physical properties records. For example, the records of MS and GRA bulk density, while also containing discrete millennial-scale peaks, display some peak magnitudes much higher than peaks within the IRD record, particularly at ∼145–155 ka ( Fig. 5 ). The sediment parameter that most closely approximates the IRD concentration is weight percent >150 μm, displaying most (but not all) of the discrete IRD peaks ( Fig. 5 and Fig. 9 ). Although the majority of IRD peaks is present within the weight percent >150-μm signal, the magnitude of some of the events differs from the IRD cps. Because larger lithic grains typically weigh more, their presence is reflected by greater values of weight percent >150 μm. Within IRD cps, however, each lithic grain is counted once regardless of size and weight. This problem is exacerbated by the selection of upper and lower size limits for IRD analysis. Nonetheless, because the other sediment parameters incorporate fine sediments omitted in the IRD cps, weight percent >150 μm provides the best approximation of IRD at Site 1094. 4.2. Glacial-to-interglacial variability IRD in sediments at Site 1094 is composed overwhelmingly of ash and quartz. Geochemical analysis of IRD in nearby sediment cores suggests the ash in South Atlantic sediments is derived principally from volcanic eruptions in the South Sandwich Islands in the Scotia Arc, West Antarctica, with minor contribution from nearby Bouvet Island ( Cooke and Hays, 1982 and Smith et al., 1983 ). Carried to the east by prevailing winds, ash then settles on ice shelves in the Weddell Sea and on seasonal sea ice, which acts as a conveyor of ash to the South Atlantic Ocean during its seasonal advance and retreat. The quartz and other non-ash lithics are sourced from Antarctica by calving of icebergs ( Smith et al., 1983 and Labeyrie et al., 1986 ). The majority of icebergs originate from ice shelves such as those found in the Weddell Sea where debris-rich basal ice can be produced by melting and freezing at the base of these ice shelves ( Warnke, 1970 and Hulbe, 1997 ). If IRD transport were exclusively by icebergs, the relative proportions of the primary components, ash and quartz, would be the same throughout the South Atlantic. However, ash is the dominant component in Site 1094 at 53°S, whereas quartz is the dominant component in core TTN057-21 at 41°S. Site 1094 is situated south of the polar front where cool SST permits sea-ice rafting. In contrast, core TTN057-21 at 41°S is situated north of both the present-day polar front and the glacial position of the polar front where the comparably warm SST inhibits sea-ice rafting ( Brathauer and Abelmann, 1999 and Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). Consequently, although ash is transported both by icebergs and by sea ice, sea-ice rafting appears to be an important mechanism in the South Atlantic. Strong glacial–interglacial distinctions occur in the record of IRD delivery to Site 1094, with very high IRD levels during the glacial periods and very low levels during the interglacial periods ( Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 ). The increase in IRD during glacials may be due to increased production of icebergs, increased survival of icebergs and sea ice, or dilution by biogenic material. During the last glaciation when sea level was ∼120 m lower than today, peripheral ice shelves around Antarctica were more extensive as grounding lines advanced seaward over the continental shelf ( Denton and Hughes, 1983 and Bindschadler et al., 1998 ). Expansion of the WAIS during the glacial period increased the proportion of marine-based ice, and attendant delivery of IRD to the South Atlantic. Additionally, isostatic depression of the continental shelf beneath the large glacial WAIS could render it susceptible to relative sea-level rise and subsequent buoyancy increase and unpinning along its margins ( Anderson and Thomas, 1991 ). In addition to the higher calving rates associated with increased ice volume in the Weddell Sea region, cooler glacial SST would enhance the survival and long-distance transport of debris-laden icebergs and sea ice to the core site ( Matsumoto, 1996 ). Increased survivability associated with cool glacial SST may have resulted in an increase in the relative percent IRD within the sediments, even without an increase in the rate of iceberg production ( Keany et al., 1976 ). Sea-ice coverage and frontal boundary positions control biosiliceous sedimentation to South Atlantic sediments ( Burckle et al., 1982 , Westfall and Fenner, 1991 , Charles et al., 1991 and Asmus et al., 1999 ) and, consequently, IRD content. During cool intervals, the polar front migrated northward and sea ice expanded over the site resulting in a decline in biosiliceous productivity ( Crosta et al., 1998 and Brathauer and Abelmann, 1999 ). As a result, the relative percent IRD within the sediments increased, even without an increase in their rate of delivery to the site. However, IRD expressed as an accumulation rate corrects for dilution and shows increases during cool intervals similar to that observed in the concentration data. 4.3. Suborbital variability In addition to well-defined glacial–interglacial cycles, suborbital variability is clearly present in the records of IRD and whole-core physical properties measurements at Site 1094. For the last glacial period, these prominent events have been correlated with IRD layers in cores situated north of the PFZ and have been interpreted as evidence of abrupt episodes of instability of the AIS in the Weddell Sea region ( Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). Examination of the past four glaciations reveals that, in addition to generally high IRD, each is characterized by discrete pulses in IRD delivery to Site 1094 that occurred on millennial timescales ( Fig. 6 ). With few exceptions, the abrupt IRD events are accompanied by brief episodes of high foraminiferal abundances originating from iceberg-induced upwelling or high SST ( Fig. 6 ) ( Labeyrie et al., 1986 and Grobe and Mackensen, 1992 ). Based on our chronology derived from SPECMAP tie points, the temporal spacing of discrete peaks in IRD during MIS 6, MIS 8 and MIS 11 appears to be ∼3–12, ∼2–9 and ∼2–8 kyr, respectively. However, two factors make it difficult to ascertain if this differs significantly from that observed for the last glacial period (∼6–10 kyr; Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). First, the IRD fluctuations during MIS 6 and 8 are less distinct making it difficult to identify individual events and, second, the chronology is coarse. We can, however, ascertain if the relationship of these events with other suborbital changes within the same record is consistent for different glacial periods. For example, do the millennial-scale IRD peaks ‘march’ through the changing climatic conditions of MIS 2, 3 and 4 as well as similar (unnamed) changes within MIS 6? Whereas MIS 3 is marked by several rapid δ 18 O fluctuations, the variability in MIS 2 and 4 is comparably reduced. A similar pattern occurs in estimated temperatures at Vostok during the last glaciation. Millennial-scale IRD events do occur during each of the three stages, but their magnitude and frequency is greatest during MIS 3. This is consistent with McManus et al. (1999) who argue for relative climatic stability in the northern hemisphere during full glacial periods and interglacial periods, and increased variability in the intervening climate states. As in the last glaciation, IRD variability occurs throughout MIS 6. However, unlike the last glaciation, IRD events of greater magnitude and frequency do not occur during the interval containing numerous rapid δ 18 O fluctuations. Suborbital variability within the interglacial periods exists with less regularity than the glacial periods ( Fig. 7 ). Within the glacial periods SST was near freezing year-round and we interpret IRD, therefore, as a signal of iceberg production. During interglacial periods, Site 1094 is south of the Polar Front and north of the winter sea-ice margin. Fluctuations in the positions of these boundaries would affect iceberg and sea-ice survivability. Therefore, the controls on IRD during interglacial periods may be different from those during glacial periods. Each of the last five interglacial periods begins similarly, marked by an IRD-free interval with abundant foraminifera occurring at a time when temperature over Antarctica is high ( Fig. 4 and Fig. 7 ). Following this, each interglacial is characterized by a return to more glacial conditions, or a ‘neoglaciation’ in which ice-rafting resumes abruptly and fluctuates irregularly while foraminiferal abundances decline ( Kirby et al., 1998 , Brachfield and Banerjee, 2000 and Yoon, 2000 ). The nature of the hypsithermal, however, differs among the interglacial periods. Previous studies have postulated that MIS 11 was the warmest interglacial period of the late Pleistocene ( Oppo et al., 1990 and Hodell, 1993 ). In contrast, the planktonic δ 18 O minimum of MIS 11 at Site 1094 remained heavier than minimum values observed in MIS 9 and 5e which suggests, all other factors being equal, that SST in the southeast Atlantic were not significantly warmer during MIS 11 compared to the subsequent interglacial stages ( Hodell et al., 2000 ). Although not unique with respect to the magnitude of its SST, the MIS 11 hypsithermal exhibited relatively IRD-free conditions that appear to have persisted for a substantially longer period of time than observed in the later interglacial periods. Our age model, derived from correlation to SPECMAP, is admittedly coarse, particularly during MIS 11 ( Fig. 2 ). However, based upon this chronology, indicators of ice-rafting to the southeast Atlantic appear to have remained near zero for more than 30 kyr, compared to ∼5–15 kyr in the hypsithermal intervals of subsequent interglacial periods. Such a particularly IRD-free interval implies diminished calving or size of the ice sheet or both ( McManus et al., 1999 ). The duration of sustained IRD-free conditions at Site 1094 may be due to orbital configuration. Eccentricity at MIS 11 was low and the amplitude of the precession cycle was damped with the result that fewer cold substages punctuated the interglacial ( Hodell et al., 2000 ). The nature of the neoglaciation also differs among the interglacial periods. Although the two youngest interglacial periods (MIS 5 and 1) and MIS 9 and 11 were marked by a resumption of ice-rafting, delivery of IRD remained low relative to those of the glacial periods. In contrast, the neoglaciation of MIS 7 exhibits IRD concentrations approaching values typical of full glacial periods. The δ 18 O during MIS 7 increased concomitantly with the IRD. Again, this difference between the interglacial periods is likely a reflection of the different orbital configurations of each ( Fig. 10 ). Precession is large during MIS 7 with the result that the magnitude of cold substages is much stronger. Millennial-scale variability on termination I is characterized by a reversal to cooler temperatures or the so-called Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) ( Jouzel et al., 1987 ). In the Site 1094 record, the ACR is marked by greater δ 18 O values and a brief, but prominent pulse in IRD delivery to the core site ( Fig. 8 ) ( Kanfoush et al., 2000 ). IRD within the ACR is comprised of two rapid peaks in quartz, the younger of which is accompanied by a single large peak in ash. Termination V is the only other glacial termination punctuated by a pronounced quartz peak. The rate of IRD decrease across the terminations differs also, with a gradual, step-wise decrease across terminations I and V and an abrupt decrease across terminations II and IV. In each case, however, concentrations of IRD decrease very early in the terminations with values approaching zero well prior to the end of each glacial termination. Estimates of SST derived from diatoms in Site 1094 sediments indicate that substantial warming of South Atlantic surface waters and reduction of sea-ice occurred early in terminations I and V ( Kunz-Pirung and Gersonde , this volume; Shemesh et al., submitted ). Consequently, high biosiliceous productivity may have led to dilution of IRD delivered to Site 1094 sediments. In addition, SST increase early in the termination may have decreased survivability and transport distances of debris-laden icebergs resulting in a decrease in IRD delivery to Site 1094 early in the termination. The brief reversal to cooler SST associated with the ACR may have caused an expansion of sea ice and increased survivability of icebergs, both of which may have increased IRD concentrations in sediments at Site 1094. If SST increase is responsible for the reduction in IRD delivery to Site 1094 during glacial terminations, the gradual, step-wise IRD decrease across terminations I and V implies SST increase occurred in a gradual, step-wise manner. In contrast, the abrupt IRD decrease early in terminations II and IV suggests SST increase was abrupt and began early in the terminations. 4.4. Marine sediment–ice correlation We propose that Site 1094 at 53°S can be correlated to the Vostok ice core using sodium concentration in Vostok and percent ash in South Atlantic sediments because both parameters are influenced by the extent of sea-ice cover in the South Atlantic Ocean. Atmospheric circulation, driven by the ocean–Antarctica temperature gradient, is most vigorous during the austral winter when sea ice is at its maximum extent. This results in efficient transport of this marine aerosol to the South Pole ( Petit et al., 1999 ). In Site 1094, ash and radiolarians strongly dominate the coarse sediment fraction and both are related to sea-ice cover at Site 1094. Ash is transported in part by sea ice, and sea-ice cover inhibits radiolarian productivity ( Keany et al., 1976 and Smith et al., 1983 ; Gersonde and Zielinski, 2000 ). Consequently, as sea-ice cover increases, percent ash increases and radiolarian abundance falls. We elected to use percent ash to correlate the Site 1094 record to Vostok, but could have used percent radiolaria as it is essentially the inverse of the percent ash signal ( Fig. 11 ). The correlation yields close agreement between changes in Vostok-inferred temperature and δ 18 O of the marine record on both orbital and millennial timescales ( Fig. 11 ). On glacial–interglacial timescales, regional atmospheric temperature controls changes in ice-rafting via its influence on SST and, hence, survivorship and transport distances of sea ice and icebergs. Reconstructions of SST based upon South Atlantic diatoms and radiolarians reflect the regional atmospheric temperature control on SST, showing much similarity with temperature recorded at Vostok ( Pichon et al., 1992 and Brathauer and Abelmann, 1999 ). In general (but not always), IRD delivery to Site 1094 is high when inferred temperature at Vostok is cool (less than ∼−3.5 to −4.0°C). IRD often drops precipitously, sometimes approaching zero, at times when temperatures over Antarctica warm to greater than this. Such declines in ice-rafting occur during the two most prominent warm intervals within MIS 7, much of MIS 5, the brief warm interval at ∼14.5 ka and the early Holocene. Dominated by quartz, the IRD of the late Holocene differs in composition relative to that of the previous interglacials and the majority of the record (which is dominated by ash). Termination V is punctuated by a brief but large peak in quartz and is the only other instance in which quartz is dominant. One possible explanation is a difference in provenance. However, for the Holocene, the correlation to Vostok suggests this may result from SST too warm to allow significant sea-ice rafting of ash. Similarly, estimates of SST derived from diatoms in Site 1094 sediments indicate that substantial warming of South Atlantic surface waters and reduction of sea ice occurred in termination V (Kunz-Pirung, this volume). Resumption of IRD delivery to Site 1094 in the late Holocene occurs when inferred temperature at Vostok remains warm (>∼0°C) and δ 18 O remains relatively unchanged. Ice-rafting to Site 1094 resumes during MIS 5 even before the end of the Eemian following an essentially IRD-free interval. Similar to the Holocene, the first neoglacial IRD peak during the Eemian occurs while inferred temperature at Vostok is ∼0°C. However, it does follow a rapid drop in temperature from the early Eemian maximum (>3°C). During MIS 11, IRD delivery increases while δ 18 O remains relatively unchanged, however temperature at Vostok has decreased substantially by this time (from more than +2°C to less than −4°C). In MIS 7 and 9, the neoglaciation corresponds to substantially heavier δ 18 O values and cooler Vostok temperatures (less than ∼−3.5 to −4.0°C) that likely enhanced long-distance transport of sea ice. The record of IRD concentration exhibits broad similarities with the dust record in Vostok ( Fig. 12 ). There is similarity on timescales somewhat intermediate between orbital and suborbital. Glacial–interglacial patterns are clearly evident in each and some (but not all) of the millennial-scale events match. High dust concentrations during glacial periods reflect continental aridity, dust mobilization and transport, whereas the presence of larger particles indicates more turbulent atmospheric circulation in the high southern latitudes ( Petit et al., 1999 ). Petit et al. (1999) suggested that peaks in dust in Vostok correspond to periods of steepened winter ocean–Antarctica temperature gradient resulting from expansion of sea ice in the South Atlantic. The general correspondence of percent ash with dust in Vostok may be explained by sea-ice expansion because ash is rafted, in part, by sea ice ( Keany et al., 1976 and Smith et al., 1983 ). Quartz, which is not dominantly rafted by sea ice, also exhibits a similar broad-scale correspondence with dust. This may be explained by increased iceberg survivorship and transport distances at times when SST are cool enough to permit sea-ice expansion. The MS and GRA bulk densities, which approximate the IRD record, show a corresponding degree of similarity with the dust record. Comparison of NGR and log Vostok dust reveals striking similarity ( Fig. 12 ). The prominent saw-toothed pattern displayed by NGR is present in the dust record and many of the millennial-scale peaks are represented in both. NGR reflects influx of uranium- and thorium-bearing terrigenous materials, including dust, much of which is sourced from the Patagonia region of South America ( Grousset et al., 1992 and Basile et al., 1997 ). The NGR signal, therefore, is dominated by fine-grained terrigenous particles largely of eolian origin whereas the other proxies of terrigenous influx to Site 1094 (IRD, MS and GRA bulk density) reflect terrigenous material transported to the site via ice-rafting. Other processes that may also contribute terrigenous fines to Site 1094 include eolian transport, focusing by deep currents, advection within the nephaloid layer, or a combination of these. 5. Conclusions (1) The whole-core measurements of sediment physical properties, MS and GRA bulk density, displayed much (but not all) of the variability present within the visually determined IRD record for both glacial and interglacial periods. Consequently, for Site 1094, and likely others situated south of the present-day PFZ where sedimentation is controlled by similar processes, these parameters are to a limited extent a proxy of IRD. Weight percent >150 yielded the best estimate of IRD. The NGR signal is not a proxy for IRD but rather exhibited strong similarity with the record of dust concentration in Vostok on millennial timescales. (2) Suborbital variability in ice-rafting at Site 1094 characterizes glacial periods and interglacial periods of the late Pleistocene. Millennial-scale pulses in IRD delivery to the South Atlantic, interpreted as episodes of instability of the AIS, occurred during each of the last four glacial periods (MIS 2–4, MIS 6, MIS 8 and MIS 10). Variability within each of the last five interglacial periods (the Holocene, MIS 5, MIS 7, MIS 9 and MIS 11) includes an early hypsithermal period characterized by low IRD, MS and GRA bulk density and high foraminiferal abundance and percent reflectance. A reversal of these conditions characterized the latter parts of the interglacial periods and is interpreted as a return to more glacial conditions, a neoglaciation. (3) Suborbital variability in ice-rafting at Site 1094 differs among glacial periods and among interglacial periods. Thus, the nature (magnitude, frequency, perhaps even composition) of IRD peaks is to some extent dependent upon orbital configuration. Within the limitations of our chronology, the duration of hypsithermal conditions appears to have been greater for MIS 11 than other interglacial periods of the late Pleistocene. The neoglaciations of MIS 7 and 9 were associated with a substantial increase in δ 18 O; however, the neoglaciation of MIS 5 began prior to the end of the Eemian and was accompanied by only a modest increase in δ 18 O. Oxygen isotopic values during the late Holocene neoglaciation are unchanged. Precession is large during MIS 7 with the result that the magnitude of cold substages was much larger and ice-rafting more abundant than in other interglacial periods of the past 420 000 years. (4) We postulate percent ash in the marine sediment record from Site 1094 and sodium concentration in the Vostok ice core are both controlled by areal extent of sea ice. They, therefore, provided a means for correlation between the South Atlantic sediments and Antarctic ice at resolution sufficient to examine the phasing of marine and atmospheric changes on millennial scales. NGR exhibits similarities with dust concentration in Vostok. One possible explanation is that it is attributed to periods of vigorous atmospheric circulation resulting from steepened ocean–Antarctica thermal gradients associated with sea-ice expansion. Peaks in IRD also show broad-scale (on timescales somewhat intermediate between Milankovitch and suborbital) similarities with Vostok dust and likely reflect enhanced sea-ice and iceberg survivability in cooler SST at times of sea-ice expansion.
