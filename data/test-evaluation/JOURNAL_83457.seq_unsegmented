The oldest record of webbed bird and pterosaur tracks from South Korea (Cretaceous Haman Formation, Changseon and Sinsu Islands): More evidence of high avian diversity in East Asia Abstract Tracks of web-footed birds and pterosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian) Haman Formation of Changseon and Sinsu Islands, respectively (southern coast of Korea), represent the oldest records for these footprint types in Asia. The morphology of the bird tracks, with prominent posteriorly directed hallux impression, semi-palmate web, and small ratio of length to width is similar to Hwangsanipes choughi from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Uhangri Formation. However, they about 20–25% smaller, and therefore much closer to the size of North American Ignotornis (size difference less than 10%). The development of the web appears intermediate in size between Hwangsanipes and Ignotornis . This leads us to infer a new ichnotaxon herein named Ignotornis yangi . This is the first Asian report of a named bird track similar to the type material of Ignotornis from North America. Pterosaur tracks consist predominantly of clear impressions of tridactyl mani (length 9–13 cm) characterized by strongly asymmetric digit impressions that outnumber less-clear elongated pes traces by a ratio of about 10 to 1. Clusters of short digit impressions or parallel to subparallel scrape marks indicate incomplete pes traces probably made by swimming animals. The pterosaur tracks, here provisionally identified as Pteraichnus , represent the first record of this ichnogenus from Korea. The track maker represents a species quite different from the giant track maker represented by the ichnogenus Haenamichnus from the Cenomanian Uhangri Formation, but it is similar to recent reports of Pteraichnus -like forms from the Lower Cretaceous of China. These new records shed light on patterns of bird-track diversity and abundance in the “mid” Cretaceous of Korea (Aptian-Cenomanian) and show that at least two quite distinct pterosaurian species existed during this time span with at least six distinct species of track-making birds. When combined with additional reports of bird track ichnotaxa from China, the picture emerges of a remarkably diverse Lower Cretaceous avifauna. Such diversity is consistent with the skeletal record for this region, though the types of birds represented by tracks are “shorebird-like” and therefore distinct from the skeletal avifauna, which consist of birds of the perching type. The ability of tracks to record whole foot morphology including details of web and hallux configuration allows for fine discrimination of foot morphology and comparison with web-footed tracks from other regions and geologic time periods. As is the case with modern shore birds, Cretaceous tracks were probably mostly made by adults whose foot size as well as shape is probably indicative of the identity of the track maker at low taxonomic levels.

Introduction In recent years there has been an exponential increase in the discovery of bird and pterosaur tracks. The track record can be particularly instructive in adding information that is not otherwise available from the realm of body fossils. Especially in Korea there has been a significant increase in the rate of discovery of Cretaceous bird tracks with many additional reports from the Cretaceous of other regions including China, Japan, Israel, Spain, Canada, USA, and Argentina ( Mehl, 1931 , Avnimelech, 1966 , Kim, 1969 , Currie, 1981 , Zhen et al., 1987 , Lockley et al., 1992 , Yang et al., 1995 , Vidarte, 1996 , Baek and Yang, 1997 , Lockley and Matsukawa, 1998 , Lim et al., 2000 , Azuma et al., 2002 and Coria et al., 2002 ). However, only a few webbed bird tracks including ten named and six unnamed ichnospecies have been previously reported from Cretaceous through Neogene strata ( Table 1 ). The purpose of this paper is to describe the new Changseon site in the Haman Formation ( Fig. 1 ), from which 11 well-preserved trackways (comprising 80 footprints) of web-footed birds have been reported, and to provide a discussion of where these tracks fit into the morphological and ichnotaxonomic record of a rapidly expanding database of bird tracks from East Asia. We also describe the first Pteraichnus -like tracks (comprising at least three trackways and about 30 partial and complete tracks) from the Haman Formation of Sinsu Island ( Fig. 1 ), and compare them with other pterosaur tracks from the Cretaceous of Korea and China. 2. Tracks of web-footed birds Cretaceous web-footed bird tracks are known from at least seven separate geographical areas, four of which are found in Korea. The general localities of the Korean sites, in order of discovery are: western Goseong County ( Lockley et al., 1992 ; this paper), Hwangsan Basin ( Yang et al., 1995 , Yang et al., 1997 and Yang et al., 2003 ), Kyungnam ( Baek and Yang, 1997 and Yang et al., 1997 ) and the Changseon site described herein. There are two North American sites described from Colorado ( Mehl, 1931 ) and Wyoming ( Lockley et al., 2004 ), and one described from Argentina ( Coria et al., 2002 ). The ichnotaxa considered to represent web-footed birds are as follows: Ignotornis mcconnelli ( Mehl, 1931 ) from Colorado, cf. Ignotornis Mehl, 1931 from Argentina ( Coria et al., 2002 ) and Sarjeantopodus semipalmatus ( Lockley et al., 2004 ) from Wyoming ( Table 1 ). Uhangrichnus chuni and Hwangsanipes choughi ( Yang et al., 1995 ) are known from the Uhangri Formation of the Hwangsan Basin in southwestern Korea, and the former ichnotaxon ( U. chuni ) is reported from the Kyungnam site ( Baek and Yang, 1997 ). In this study we report well-preserved and extensive trackways of a new morphotype similar to the type material of Ignotornis from Haman Formation outcrops on Changseon Island in the Kyongsang Basin ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ). Elsewhere in the Kyongsang Basin there have been additional reports of these and other bird tracks both from the Haman and overlying Jindong formations ( Kim, 1969 , Lockley et al., 1992 , Baek and Yang, 1997 , Lim et al., 2000 and Lim et al., 2002 ). These include Koreanornis and Jindongornipes , both of which lack web traces. In addition to these reports, a new ichnospecies, Goseongornipes markjonesi , has been reported from the Jindong Formation ( Lockley et al., 2006 ; see Table 2 herein). As this species ( G. markjonesi ) also lacks any clear trace of webbing, none of the Jindong Formation bird tracks represent web-footed track makers. By contrast both the aforementioned bird tracks from the Uhangri Formation ( U. chuni and H. choughi ) represent web-footed species. The material described herein from the Haman Formation at the Changseon site, while similar to G. markjonesi , evidently has better-developed semi-palmate webbing and a much longer hallux and must therefore be assigned to a different ichnotaxon. Although morphologically quite similar to Hwangsanipes choughi from the younger Uhangri Formation ( Yang et al., 1995 ), the Changseon material is considerably smaller, with a less well-developed web, and has many features much closer to Ignotornis mcconnelli ( Mehl, 1931 ), except that it is slightly larger (about 10%) with a somewhat larger web. This similarity was noted by Lim et al. (2002) . It is important to compare all these tracks in order to see the size and shape differences (see Lockley et al., 2006 , and Fig. 3 herein). Five named and five unnamed ichnospecies of webbed bird tracks have been also reported from Paleogene and Neogene strata. They are unnamed webbed bird tracks ( Johnson, 1986 ), Presbyorniformipes feduccii ( Moussa, 1968 and Yang et al., 1995 ), Charadriipeda ( Panin and Avram, 1962 , emended Sarjeant and Langston, 1994 ), heron-like or stork-like wading bird tracks ( de Raaf et al., 1965 ), Anatipeda anas ( Panin, 1965 ), and Avipeda ichnosp. ( Scrivner and Bottjer, 1986 ), Roepichnus grahami ( Doyle et al., 2000 ), goose footprints ( Miller and Ashley, 1934 ), and goose or goose-like tracks ( Breed, 1973 ). 3. Pterosaur tracks Since the first discovery of pterosaur tracks named Pteraichnus from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation ( Stokes, 1957 ), these tracks have been controversial. Padian and Olsen (1984) argued that Pteraichnus is attributable to a crocodilian ( Unwin, 1989 , Padian and Rayner, 1993 , Padian, 1998 and Padian, 2003 ). These arguments have been widely challenged by the discovery of a large amount of Pteraichnus material mainly from Europe and North America ( Lockley et al., 1995 , Lockley et al., 1997 , Lockley et al., 2001a , Lockley et al., 2001b , Mazin et al., 1995 , Mazin et al., 1997 , Mazin et al., 2003 , Wright et al., 1997 , Calvo and Moratalla, 1998 , Meijide Calvo and Fuentes Vidarte, 1999 , Pascual Arribas and Sanz Perez, 2000 , Garcia-Ramos et al., 2000 , Garcia-Ramos et al., 2001 , Calvo and Lockley, 2001 , Hwang et al., 2002 , Rodriguez de la Rosa, 2003 , Billon-Bruyat and Mazin, 2003 , Lockley and Wright, 2003 , Sayao, 2003 , Mickelson et al., 2004a and Mickelson et al., 2004b ). The pterosaur tracks from Sinsu Island are therefore an additional contribution to a growing database on pterosaurian ichnites. They are of particular interest because of what appear to be a mix of manus-only and manus-dominated trackways with associated swim tracks. The functional morphology and lifestyle of pterosaurs has also been the subject of much discussion ( Lockley et al., 1995 , Bennett, 1997 , Lockley and Mickelson, 1997 , Unwin, 1997 , Unwin, 1999 , Lockley and Wright, 2003 and Mazin et al., 2003 ). Although trackways assigned to pterosaurs remain controversial in some quarters ( Padian, 2003 ) it has become widely accepted that Pteraichnus morphologies are pterosaurian ( Chatterjee and Templin, 2004 ). 4. Geological setting The Cretaceous strata exposed in the southeastern part of Korea are referred to the Gyeongsang Supergroup ( Chang, 1975 ). A nonmarine origin for the rocks of this supergroup has long been recognized from the occurrence of fossil plants ( Yabe, 1905 and Tateiwa, 1929 ), freshwater mollusks ( Yang, 1975 , Yang, 1978 , Yang, 1979a and Yang, 1979b ), dinosaur footprints ( Yang, 1982 , Yang, 1986 , Lim et al., 1989 , Lim et al., 1994 and Lockley et al., 1992 ), pollen and spores ( Choi, 1985 ), and charophytes ( Seo, 1985 and Choi, 1987 ). According to Chang, 1975 and Chang, 1982 , the supergroup has been divided, in ascending stratigraphic order, into the Sindong (Berriasian–Barremian), Hayang (Aptian–middle Albian), and Yucheon Groups (upper Albian–Cenomanian) and the Bulgugsa Intrusives ( Chang, 1982 ; Fig. 1 ). The Sindong Group consists mainly of alluvial fan, floodplain, and lacustrine deposits, the Hayang Group consists of floodplain and lacustrine sediments intercalated with minor volcanic ash beds ( Um et al., 1987 ), and the overlying Yucheon Group consists of volcanic rocks. The Hayang Group consists of, in ascending order, the Chilgog Formation, Silla Conglomerate, and Haman and Jindong formations. The Haman Formation rests conformably on the Silla Conglomerate and its thickness is estimated to exceed 1000 m. It is mainly composed of reddish shale and sandy shale and white to greenish and gray sandstones with minor intercalating tuffaceous and pebbly sandstone. They are metamorphosed into compact hornfels in the vicinity of the stock shaped granodiorite. The hornfels is tinged with a reddish color in the lower levels and with greenish gray color in the higher levels of the formation ( Chi et al., 1983 ). In the study area, the Haman Formation generally dips less than 20° SE and was intruded by the Bulgugsa Intrusives. Many dinosaur footprints and four kinds of bird tracks including Koreanaornis hamanensis ( Kim, 1969 , Lockley et al., 1992 and Baek and Yang, 1997 ), Jindongornipes kimi ( Baek and Yang, 1997 ), Uhangrichnus chuni ( Baek and Yang, 1997 ), and unnamed webbed bird tracks ( Lim et al., 2000 ) have been reported from the Haman Formation. The webbed bird tracks described herein as Ignotornis yangi ( Fig. 4 ) occur in the middle part of the Haman Formation ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ), which consists of centimeter-scale rhythmic alternations of fine-grained siliciclastic sediment. In the measured section at the northeast of the Changseon Island the fine- to medium-grained sandstone frequently exhibits parallel lamination, cross-stratified lamination, convoluted bedding, flame structures, and ripple marks ( Fig. 2 ). Fossil plants, raindrop imprints, and mud cracks are also observed on the bedding planes of the interbedded shale to mudstone. Pterosaur tracks are found on the bedding surface of well-laminated fine-grained sandstone of the upper middle part of the Haman Formation in the Sinsu section ( Fig. 2 ). The Sinsu section is mainly composed of well-laminated fine-grained sandstone, black shale, and fine- to medium-grained sandstone. Sauropod tracks, mud cracks, and ripple marks are observed on the fine-grained sandstone, and invertebrate trace fossils including Cochlichnus anguineus and Helminthoidichnites tenuis occur on the bedding surfaces of the black shale. Together with these footprints diverse invertebrate trace fossils, ripple marks, mud cracks, and raindrop imprints ( Baek and Yang, 1997 and Seo, 1997 ) provide evidence for a lakeshore environment ( Lim et al., 2002 ). 5. Ichnotaxonomy 5.1. Systematic observations The large increase in reports of Mesozoic and Cenozoic bird tracks has highlighted the need for revision of the ichnotaxonomy of fossil bird tracks. Fortunately the ichnotaxonomy at the ichnogenus and ichnospecies level is fairly straightforward, at least for Cretaceous tracks. However, organization at the supra-generic level has largely been ignored. For example Lockley et al. (1992) included most known Cretaceous bird tracks in the ichnofamily Ignotornidae. This preliminary classification is in need of amendment as it is now clear that we can draw well-defined distinctions between avian ichnotaxa on the basis of diagnostic features such as the presence or absence and the size and orientation of the hallux and the degree of web development ( Fig. 3 ). The following observations suggest the direction such revisions should take. We suggest restricting the definition of Ignotornidae to tracks that closely resemble Ignotornis , i.e., the type material ( I. mcconnelli , Fig. 5 ) and forms like Hwangsanipes and the Changseon specimens ( I. yangi ) that have well-developed hallux impressions and asymmetric, semi-palmate webbing ( Fig. 3 E–G).Forms such as Uhangrichnus , which have fully developed web impressions (and no hallux) could easily be accommodated in their own ichnofamily, perhaps based on that ichnogenus. Likewise, non-webbed forms such as Koreanornis ( Fig. 3 A) and Aquatilavipes that lack well-developed web and hallux traces probably also belong in a separate ichnofamily. This was suggested by Sarjeant and Langston (1994) , who placed Aquatilavipes in the “morphofamily Avipedidae” without reference to its previous assignment to the Ignotornidae ( Lockley et al., 1992 ). However, since we amend this 1992 classification herein, the Sarjeant and Langston proposal is a step in the right direction of recognizing that Aquatilavipes belongs in a separate ichnofamily from Ignotornis ( Lockley et al., 2006 ). Similarly, there are forms with intermediate length hallux impressions and no web traces such as Jindongornipes and Goseongornipes ( Fig. 3 B–C), now removed from Ignotornidae. In short, the diversity of Cretaceous bird tracks in Korea alone is sufficient to suggest at least three, perhaps four, broad morphological categories that merit serious consideration at the ichnofamilial level. These must be compared with those proposed by Sarjeant and Langston (1994) on the basis of Tertiary (Miocene and Late Eocene tracks) . Thus, the ichnofamilial classification of bird tracks is in need of further attention. Sarjeant and Langston (1994) attempted to bring order to the classification by elevating the ichnogenus categories of Panin and Avram (1962) , based on modern bird family names (i.e., Gruipeda, Charadriipeda, Avipeda and Anatapeda) to the level of track-based morphofamilies. Thus, they proposed four: Gruipedidae, Charadriipedidae, Avipedidae, and Anatapedidae, based on Tertiary tracks (upper Eocene and Miocene). However, Sarjeant and Langston (1994) did not make reference to either the ichnofamily Ignotornidae or Trisaurpodiscidae named by Lockley et al. (1992) in the context of a review of Mesozoic tracks. We also note that the ichnological literature contains no clear statement about whether the categories “morphofamily” and “ichnofamily” imply any meaningful distinction. This history raises two questions for future investigation: (1) is there any overlap between the original concept of Ignotornidae ( Lockley et al., 1992 ) and the four morphofamilies proposed by Sarjeant and Langston (1994) , and (2) are Mesozoic bird track morphologies sufficiently similar to Tertiary morphotypes to conform to a classification that was essentially derived from comparison of Miocene tracks with modern bird footprints? We can tentatively answer the first question by noting that further formal classification of Mesozoic bird tracks is necessary in order to better describe morphological variation at the familial level. Our revised and restricted definition of ichnofamily Ignotornidae should allow ichnologists to recognize some of the morphofamilies proposed by Sarjeant and Langston (1994) as useful, rather than rejecting them as synonyms of Ignotornidae and/or Trisaurpodiscidae. 5.2. Systematic descriptions A total of 80 webbed bird tracks and 12 manus and about four recognizable pes tracks of pterosaurs from the Haman Formation of the Changseon and Sinsu Islands were mapped and measured ( Table 3 , Fig. 4 and Fig. 6 ). Replicas of the specimens for this study are housed in the Department of Earth Science, Korea National University of Education, Chungbuk. Ichnofamily Ignotornidae Lockley et al., 1992 Ichnogenotype Ignotornis Mehl, 1931 emend. Lockley et al., 1992 ( Fig. 5 herein) Emended diagnosis . Tetradactyl bird tracks showing prominent postero-medially-directed hallux impressions comprising about one third of total track length. Hypex between digits III and IV more anteriorly situated than hypex between digits II and III, with tendency for development of asymmetric, semi-palmate web that is more strongly developed between digits III and IV. Digit divarication between II and IV, wide usually averaging at least 110–120°. Digit pad impressions variable, but sometimes showing a 2-3-4 phalangeal formula corresponding to digits II, III, and IV. Step typically short with a strong tendency towards inward rotation. Referred material . Ignotornis mcconnelli Mehl, 1931 ; Hwangsanipes choughi Yang et al., 1995 ; Ignotornis yangi ichnosp. nov. (this paper); unnamed specimen Lim et al. (2000, fig. 3) and Lim et al. (2002, fig. 3) . Ignotornis yangi ichnosp. nov. Fig. 4 . Derivation of name . After Seong-Young Yang, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, South Korea, for his contributions to vertebrate ichnology in Korea. Material . Silicon rubber mold and plaster replica of 80 tracks. Specimen number: Korea National University of Education (KNUE) 040417. Track number 66 ( Fig. 4 B) is designated as the holotype. Description . Tetradactyl and anisodactyl bird footprints with postero-medially directed hallux impression and fine acuminate claw traces on all four digits, displaying semipalmate webbing between digits II and IV. Web traces asymmetric, i.e., more developed in hypex between digits III and IV than between II and III. The average width of tracks is approximately 45 mm (range 38–51 mm), and the average length of tracks, excluding hallux, is 33 mm (range 28–37 mm) and with hallux is 51 mm (range 43–63 mm). Thus, the hallux comprises an average of 35% of track length. In the 11 trackways; the length–width ratio (excluding hallux) is 0.73 (range 0.64–0.78). The average angle of divarication between digits II and IV is 123° (range 115–130°). The angle between digits II and III averages 64° (range 50–79°) and the angle between digits III and IV averages 59° (range 45–70°). Digit III longer than II and IV and straight or slightly curved. Length of digit IV is slightly longer than that of digit II. Digits II and IV are curved slightly inward (anteriorly) or straight. On the basis of the 11 identified trackways (T 1 to T 11) , the pace length ranges from 75 to 115 mm, stride from 158 to 229 mm, pace width from 21 to 36 mm, and pace angulation from 139 to 161° in each trackway. The trackway pattern is of single tracks at regular intervals, in zigzag fashion or straight line, depending on the pace length or pace angulation, which can vary. Discussion . Ignotornis yangi is quite similar to the type species I. mcconnelli Mehl, 1931 , and to Hwangsanipes choughi ( Yang et al., 1995 ). Indeed this similarity was noted by Lim et al. (2000) . However both these latter species are larger, though the type Ignotornis (length 5.8 cm, width 5.1 cm) is significantly smaller than type H. choughi (length ca. 8 cm, mean width 6.26 cm; see Fig. 3 ). H. choughi also has a well-developed web between digits III and IV. In the case of I. mcconnelli in comparison with I. yangi , the webbing is only slightly developed in the proximal (posterior) part of the hypex between digits II and III and slightly more so in the hypex between digits III and IV ( Fig. 5 ). This web asymmetry (II-III < III-IV) is typical of many semi-palmate shore birds. U. chuni is quite different from both these ichnospecies in all major characteristics including a greater asymmetry in the web configuration ( Fig. 3 ). Yang et al. (1995) erected and described H. choughi from the Cenomanian Uhangri Formation of the Haenam area of Korea on the basis of a trackway containing four footprints (only two of which are complete). Hence, the sample was rather small. Nevertheless the morphology of at least two of the tracks including web and hallux configurations is quiet clear ( Fig. 3 ). Although our much larger sample consists of tracks that are significantly smaller (by about 25%), we nevertheless consider that the Changseon tracks are morphologically quite close to H. choughi and for this reason consider them similar at the ichnofamily level. However, given the aforementioned size and web shape differences, we consider that the tracks are significantly closer to Ignotornis , which is also closer in size (only 10% larger), also with a less developed web ( Fig. 3 ). Although H. choughi is similar to I. mcconnelli Mehl, 1931 , in general outline, on average it displays wider interdigital angles between digits II and IV. However, examination of tracks of modern shore birds with webbed feet shows that the angle varies among different taxa ( Lim et al., 2000 ). Thus, though we provide divarication data, we consider its ichnotaxonomic utility only important to the degree that significant and consistent differences are found in comparisons between adequately large samples of different ichnotaxa with similar preservation. Although the Changseon tracks are quite close in size to U. chuni , they are clearly different in having a hallux and a greater average divarication between the digits II and IV. Another obvious difference is that the web is highly developed and much more symmetric in U. chuni than in any of the other tracks recorded to date ( Yang et al., 1995 ; Fig. 3 herein). The footprint length–width ratio, excluding the hallux, of U. chuni is greater than that of H. choughi as noted by Azuma et al. (2002) . Unnamed webbed bird tracks reported from the Haman Formation of Jinju area also show remarkable similarity to I. mcconnelli ( Lim et al., 2000 ). Although it is difficult to compare our specimens of I. yangi with these unnamed webbed bird tracks because of poor preservation of the former, they appear to be similar in divarication between the digits II and IV. Thus we infer that, like the Changseon tracks, they may be assigned to Ignotornis . We can compare the Changseon Ignotornis with Goseongornipes markjonesi ( Lockley et al., 2006 ). Although both are similar in size ( Fig. 3 ) it is clear that G. markjonesi has a much shorter hallux, comprising less than one quarter of footprint length, and little or no evidence of webbing. Thus, the newly discovered Changseon material cannot be assigned to this ichnogenus. In the 11 Changseon trackways observed, most show a distinct pattern of single tracks placed at regular intervals. When making shallow tracks on an ideal substrate, the bird could move easily and therefore tended toward its natural trackway, i.e., normal walking, which is what we infer in this case. There is no evidence that the birds were hampered in their walking by a saturated or slippery substrate, or that the tracks are distorted by poor preservation. The asymmetry of footprints, i.e., slight differences in rotation of the tracks and divarication between the inner (II-III) and outer (III-IV) hypexes, is slightly different in the 11 trackways. However, tracks left by the same species in wet sand and in drier conditions while moving at different speeds may look different ( Elbroch, 2001 ). Track makers are interpreted as plover-like birds (Charadriiformes) because of their small size and high density of preserved tracks ( Lockley et al., 1992 ). However, we should be somewhat careful in making comparisons between tracks of modern Charadriiformes, which includes gulls as well as plovers and sandpipers, and Cretaceous footprints. Certainly small tracks like Koreanornis ( Kim, 1969 ) are similar to small plovers and sandpipers, which have a small hallux or no hallux at all. By contrast, both Ignotornis and Hwangsanipes have a well-developed hallux (comprising one third or more of track length). Similarly the webbing in both these ichnogenera is more pronounced than in most sandpipers and plovers, though it is convergent with patterns found in semi-palmated plovers. Lockley et al. (2004) recently reported the semi-palmated bird track Sarjeantopodus semipalmatus from the Maastrichtian of North America and noted that it is significantly larger than Hwangsanipes . Ichnogenus Pteraichnus ( Stokes, 1957 ) Pteraichnus sp. ( Lockley et al., 1995 ) Fig. 6 . Material . Silicon rubber mold and plaster replica of tracks (specimen is KNUE 040176). Description . General description as for ichnofamily Pteraichnidae ( Lockley et al., 2001b ). Manus elongate, tridactyl, strongly asymmetric between about 10 and 12 cm in length and 3–4 cm in width. Inferred digit impression I shortest, subtending an angle of about 86° relative to the trackway axis (anterior direction), with digit impression II intermediate in length, subtending an angle of about 139°, and digit impression III longest, slightly curved, and subtending an angle of 165–180°. Rare proximal traces of manus digit impression IV directed postero-medially opposite I ( Lockley et al., 1995 ). Pes: elongated impression with short digits and clusters of two, three or more short digit impressions or parallel and subparallel scrape marks or striations. The length and width of elongated pes impressions are up to 13.8 cm and 4.1 cm, respectively ( Fig. 6 D), but length may be somewhat exaggerated by sliding. Distal part of pes prints with digit impressions is occasionally observed. The widths of the clusters of short, parallel to subparallel, digit impressions are similar to those of elongated pes impressions. The distal extremities are often marked by traces of fine triangular claws that terminate sharply. Two trackways consist of four consecutive manus sets: (m1–m4, Fig. 6 A). In the larger trackway (black shading in Fig. 6 A), manus to manus pace averages 477 mm (range 407–562 mm). Manus to manus stride averages 850 mm (range 770–911 mm). Manus to manus pace angulation averages 129° (range 123–138°) indicating a regular alternation of left and right manus footprints. Only one associated pes with outward rotation appears to be recognizable anterior to manus 3 ( Fig. 6 A). Exterior trackway width is about 257 mm and interior trackway width is about 168 mm in the two trackways. In the second trackway (gray shading, Fig. 6 A) pes impressions are faint or absent. Other, smaller trackway segments are less complete with less regular alternation of steps, but, as in the clearer trackways, the pes track impressions are obscure or missing ( Fig. 6 A). Discussion . The characteristic shape of manus impressions allow these pterosaur tracks to be assigned to Pteraichnus . Elongate pes impressions and clusters of short digit impressions that resemble swim tracks of pterosaurs ( Lockley and Wright, 2003 ), closely associated on the same bedding surface, are also typical of this ichnogenus. Although Pteraichnus from Sinsu Island is about the same size as P. saltwashensis , the track is perhaps more similar to P. stokesi in that the pes tracks are rotated outward to a greater degree, and the manus digit impressions are wider relative to their length ( Lockley et al., 1995 ). However, these differences may be due to preservation. The manus-dominated assemblage is also typical of pterosaur track assemblages ( Lockley et al., 1995 ; Mickelson et al., 2004a ). This has been explained by noting that in Pteraichnus , the manus prints tend to be more deeply impressed and better defined than pes prints because they reflect the anterior position of the center of mass in pterosaurs in quadrupedal stance ( Lockley et al., 2001b ). Pterosaur tracks from the Aptian to Albian Haman Formation in the Sinsu Island represent the second oldest record of pterosaur tracks in Korea after Haenamichnus sp., which was reported from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Uhangri Formation of Korea ( Hwang et al., 2002 ). Pteraichnus -like pterosaur tracks are also known from the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian) of Gansu Province China ( Zhang et al., 2006 ). These tracks are all associated with a single trackway in which the average manus length is about 13–14 cm. For this reason the tracks are similar to those from Korea. However, the Korean tracks include some that are smaller (about 9 cm long) which are therefore the smallest pterosaur tracks currently reported from Asia. Haenamichnus , however, is much larger than any known pterosaur track with individual footprints up to more than 30 cm in length ( Lockley et al., 1997 and Hwang et al., 2002 ). 6. Discussion The discovery in the Aptian-Albian Haman Formation of web-footed tracks in association with relatively small pterosaur tracks assigned to Pteraichnus has several interesting implications when seen in conjunction with other recent reports of bird and pterosaur tracks in Korea and elsewhere in East Asia. For example, as shown in Table 2 , there are now three formations in Korea from which there are from two to four distinct bird track types. Two of these contain pterosaur tracks. If the inferred ages of these three formations are correct, we recognize six bird tracks (ichnogenera) and two pterosaur ichnotaxa in an interval of time that spans about three stages across the Lower-Upper Cretaceous boundary (i.e., Aptian-Cenomanian). No other region reveals such a striking diversity of well-preserved bird track types in the mid-Cretaceous. In North America, for example, only three mid-Cretaceous avian ichnogenera are known from a relatively small number of sites representing a much greater time span ( Mehl, 1931 , Currie, 1981 , Lockley et al., 2001a and McCrea and Sarjeant, 2001 ). Likewise in China where there are many bird tracks known, only two ichnogenera have been reported ( Zhen et al., 1995 and Lockley et al., 2006 ). We note that the Haman and Jindong formations occur in stratigraphic sequence and apparently share identical or indistinguishable examples of Koreanornis and Jindongoripes ( Fig. 7 ). The Haman Formation differs from the Jindong Formation in exhibiting Pteraichnus and has not yet yielded Goseongornipes . The Uhangri assemblage is derived from a different geological basin and has revealed two ichnotaxa ( Uhangrichnus and Haenamichnus ) that are not known from the Jindong Formation. However, the report of Uhangrichnus from the Haman Formation suggests some overlap in the avian ichnofauna. Our interpretation of the Haman tracks as Ignotornis suggests that this ichnotaxon is present in the Haman Formation of the Jinju area as also suggested by Lim et al., 2000 and Lim et al., 2002 . If we look at the shared avian and pterosaurian ichnotaxa relationships between the three formations with bird tracks, we note that the Haman ichnofauna is the most diverse. It yields five ichnogenera of which two are not found in the other two formations ( Table 2 , Fig. 7 ). Likewise the Uhangri Formation ichnofauna from the Haenam Basin reveals two out of three “indigenous” ichnotaxa. By contrast two of the three Jindong ichnogenera are shared with the Haman ichnofauna, thus stressing the close spatio-temporal relationship between these two successive formations in the same basin. We tentatively suggest that a review of Chinese avian ichnofaunas in the Cretaceous is likely to suggest a different ichnofauna as suggested by currently named ichnotaxa ( Zhen et al., 1995 , Azuma et al., 2002 , Lockley et al., 2006 and Li et al., 2005 ). Thus, we pose the question as to whether there were differences in avifaunas between the continental margins and the continental interiors during the Cretaceous. Acknowledgements We thank Dr. M.
