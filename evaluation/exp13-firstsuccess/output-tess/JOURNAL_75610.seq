Abstract
Visual
counts
of
ice-rafted
debris
(
IRD
)
,
foraminifera
,
and
radiolaria
were
made
for
~
1500
samples
in
Site
1094
spanning
the
last
four
climatic
cycles
(
marine
isotope
stages
1-11
)
.
Most
,
but
not
all
,
of
the
IRD
variability
is
captured
by
whole-core
physical
properties
including
magnetic
susceptibility
and
y-ray
attenuation
bulk
density
.
Glacial
periods
are
marked
by
high
IRD
abundance
and
millennial-scale
variability
,
which
may
reﬂect
instability
of
ice
shelves
in
the
Weddell
Sea
region
.
Each
interglacial
period
exhibits
low
IRD
and
high
foraminiferal
abundance
during
the
early
part
of
the
interglacial
,
indicating
relatively
warm
sea-surface
temperatures
and
reduced
influence
of
sea
ice
.
IRD
increases
and
foraminiferal
abundances
decrease
during
the
latter
part
of
each
interglacial
,
indicating
a
return
to
more
glacial-like
conditions
.
Glacial
terminations
I
and
V
are
each
characterized
by
a
step-wise
reduction
in
ice-rafting
punctuated
by
a
brief
pulse
in
IRD
delivery
and
reversal
in
8
'
30
.
The
coarse
fraction
of
the
sediment
is
dominated
by
ash
and
radiolaria
,
and
the
relative
abundance
of
these
components
is
remarkably
similar
to
the
concentration
of
Na
+
in
Vostok
.
Each
of
these
variables
is
believed
to
be
controlled
mainly
by
sea-ice
cover
,
thereby
providing
a
means
for
sediment
—
ice
core
correlation
.

.
Because
much
of
the
West
Antarctic
Ice
Sheet
(
WAIS
)
is
grounded
below
sea
level
,
it
is
the
most
susceptible
to
perturbations
in
sea
level
and
climate
(
Denton
et
al.
,
1986
;
Anderson
and
Thomas
,

;
Bindschadler
,

)
.
Here
we
studied
downcore
changes
in
concentration
of
icerafted
detritus
(
IRD
)
at
Site
1094
in
the
southeast
Atlantic
to
decipher
the
history
of
two
different
components
of
the
cryosphere
:
ice
sheets
discharging
into
the
Weddell
Sea
region
of
Antarctica
(
Kanfoush
et
al.
,
2000
)
and
sea
ice
(
Fig.
1
)
.
The
AIS
expanded
at
the
Last
Glacial
Maximum
,
with
most
of
the
change
concentrated
in
West
Antarctica
(
Bindschadler
,
1998
)
.
The
WAIS
was
about
two
—
thirds
larger
than
today
and
grounded
ice
shelves
in
marginal
seas
around
Antarctica
extended
to
sea
level
which
was
~
120
m
lower
than
today
.
Kanfoush
et
al.
(
2000
)
documented
millennial
—
scale
pulses
in
IRD
delivery
to
the
South
Atlantic
during
the
last
glaciation
that
represent
episodes
of
instability
of
grounded
ice
shelves
in
the
Weddell
Sea
on
suborbital
timescales
.
Variability
of
IRD
has
also
been
documented
for
the
Holocene
from
the
South
Atlantic
including
an
abrupt
late
—
Holocene
increase
in
icerafting
and
decrease
in
sea
—
surface
temperatures
(
SST
)
at
~
5.5
ka
(
Hodell
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
In
this
study
,
we
extend
the
high
—
resolution
record
of
ice
—
rafting
at
Site
1094
from
marine
isotopic
stage
(
MIS
)
1
through
11
in
order
to
examine
the
nature
of
ice
—
sheet
and
sea-ice
variability
over
the
last
four
climatic
cycles
.
The
longest
,
most
continuous
record
of
Antarctic
climate
variability
is
the
Vostok
ice
core
,
which
extends
through
the
last
420
kyr
and
captures
variability
on
millennial
timescales
(
Petit
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
Here
we
present
a
South
Atlantic
deep
—
sea
record
that
has
a
length
equaling
and
resolution
approaching
,
or
in
some
intervals
exceeding
,
that
of
the
Vostok
ice
core
.
The
utility
of
such
a
record
is
twofold
.
First
,
a
high
—
resolution
IRD
record
spanning
several
climatic
cycles
provides
an
opportunity
to
understand
the
interactions
between
variability
in
the
suborbital
and
Milanko
—
vitch
bands
.
Second
,
correlation
of
the
marinesediment
and
ice
—
core
records
will
enable
comparison
of
the
timing
and
magnitude
of
IRD
variability
in
the
South
Atlantic
with
changes
in
atmospheric
variables
recorded
in
Vostok
.
Our
study
is
similar
to
that
of
Bond
et
al.
(
1993
)
who
presented
a
correlation
between
North
Atlantic
cores
and
the
Greenland
ice
cores
which
revealed
the
relationship
between
IRD
events
(
Heinrich
events
Heinrich
,
1988
)
and
temperature
changes
over
Greenland
during
the
last
glaciation
(
Dansgaard
—
Oeschger
cycles
—
Dansgaard
et
al.
,
1993
)
.
Similarly
,
correlation
of
the
high
—
resolution
South
Atlantic
IRD
record
from
Site
1094
will
help
determine
if
Antarctic
ice
—
discharge
events
were
linked
to
external
climatic
factors
.

The

,
corresponding
to
a

Results
IRD
at

is
composed
predominantly
of
ash
(
88.3
%
of
the
lithic

and
600

)
and
quartz
(
10.9
%
and
50
grains/g
on
average
)
(
Fig.

)
.
The
strong
dominance
of
ash
within
the
total
lithic
assemblage
results
in
nearly
identical
records
of
ash
and
total
lithics
.
Consequently
,
hereafter
,
only
plots
of
quartz
and
total
lithics
are
shown
.
IRD
levels
are
generally
high
during
the
glacial
periods
(
1200
grains/g
on
average
)
and
low
during
the
interglacial
periods
(
300

)
with
a
high
degree
of
variability
within
each
of
these
periods
.
Expressed
as

,
the

were
roughly

of

whereby
values
increase
gradually
throughout
each
glacial

and
then
decrease
abruptly
at
glacial

.
The

record
is
low
during
glacial

and
high
during

,
paralleling
the
5180

It
also
exhibits

the

Glacial
periods
Throughout
the
last
glacial
period
,
discrete
episodes
of
IRD
deposition
recur
on
millennial
timescales
(
~

.
None
lasts
for
more
than
a

thousand

,
and
the
concentration
typically
returns
to
baseline
values
before
increasing
again
.
Peaks
are
composed
predominantly
of
ash
and
quartz
,
with
ash
abundances
roughly
an
order
of
magnitude
greater
than
those
of
quartz
(
surpassing
5000
grains/g
and
400

,
respectively
)
,
and
the
two
primary
constituents
closely
parallel
each
other
throughout
.
As
in
the
IRD
record
of
the
last
glacial
period
,
MS
and
GRA
bulk
density
also
contain
discrete
peaks
recurring
on
millennial
timescales
.
Values
of
these
wholecore
physical
properties
generally
do
return
to
baseline
values
before
increasing
again
but
,
unlike
the
IRD
record
,
the
baseline
is
substantially
elevated
above
the
values
of
the
contiguous
interglacial
periods
(
MIS

With

,
foraminiferal

Glacial
terminations
From
high

concentrations
,
IRD
decreases
across
each
of
the
glacial

.
This
decrease
occurs
in
a
somewhat
gradual

’
manner
in
some
cases
(
terminations
I
,
III

V
)
and
abruptly
in
others
(
terminations
II
and
IV
)
.
In
all
cases
,
however
,
the
decrease
in
IRD
occurs
early
during
the
termination
.
As
6180
values
decline
across
termination
1
,
they
display
a
brief
reversal
toward
heavier
values
before
again
declining
(

.
Within

,
there

Only

contains

An
opportunity
exists
here
to
compare
directly
IRD
concentrations
with
other
sediment
parameters
in
Site
1094
to
assess
their
utility
as
IRD
proxies
in
the
South
Atlantic
.
This
also
includes
weight
percent
of
the
coarse

fraction
(

%
>
63
um
and
wt
%
>
150
um
)
,
which
is
routinely
measured
during
sample
processing
.
In
general
,
the
glacial
—
interglacial
pattern
displayed
by
MS
and
GRA
bulk
density
is
similar
to
that
for
IRD
(
Fig.
5
)
.
This
implies
these
wholecore
physical
properties
are
controlled
by
terrigenous
inﬂux
,
largely
via
ice
—
rafting
(
Shipboard
Scientiﬁc
Party
,
1999
)
.
Discrepancies
between
the
visually
counted
IRD
and
the
whole
—
core
physical
properties
may
be
attributed
in
part
to
grain
—
size
differences
resulting
from
the
selected
upper
and
lower
sieve
limits
(
2
mm
and
150
um
,
respectively
)
utilized
for
IRD
analysis
.
Speciﬁcally
,
the
substantially
elevated
glacial
baseline
values
of
the
whole
—
core
physical
properties
may
reﬂect
the
presence
of
terrigenous
ﬁnes
omitted
in
the
visual
IRD
cps
.
Examination
of
the
weight
percent
of
the
various
size
fractions
of
the
sediment
supports
this
conclusion
(
Fig.
9
)
.
Because
of
the
greater
weight
of
the
lithics
as
compared
to
the
biogenic
components
,
the
weight
percent
of
the
>
150
—
um
fraction
provides
a
good
approximation
of
the
IRD
cps
.
However
,
inclusion
of
ﬁner
sediments
(
the
weight
percent
63
—
150
—
um
fraction
)
approaches
more
closely
the
structure
of
the
MS
and
GRA
bulk
density
records
,
speciﬁcally
the
elevated
baseline
of
glacial
periods
(
Fig.
6
)
.
Both
the
start
of
glacial
periods
and
glacial
terminations
are
recorded
as
an
abrupt
change
in
the
records
of
IRD
,
MS
and
GRA
bulk
density
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Each
of
the
past
three
glacial
terminations
is
also
abrupt
in
the
records
of
8180
,
percent
reﬂectance
and
NGR
.
However
,
the
transition
from
interglacial
to
glacial
conditions
in
these
parameters
is
recorded
as
a
gradual
change
.
NGR
is
derived
from
decay
of
natural
radioisotopes
,
including
potassium
,
uranium
and
thorium
,
and
reﬂects
inﬂux
of
terrigenous
materials
containing
these
radioisotopes
.
The
strong
anti
—
correlation
between
the
prominent
saw
—
toothed
patterns
of
NGR
and
percent
reﬂectance
,
therefore
,
implies
that
gradual
decreases
in
percent
reﬂectance
result
from
either
an
increase
in

This

explain

the

Glacial
—
to
—
interglacial
variability
IRD
in
sediments
at
Site
1094
is
composed
overwhelmingly
of
ash
and
quartz
.
Geochemical
analysis
of
IRD
in
nearby
sediment
cores
suggests
the
ash
in
South
Atlantic
sediments
is
derived
principally
from
volcanic
eruptions
in
the
South
Sandwich
Islands
in
the
Scotia
Arc
,
West
Antarctica
,
with
minor
contribution
from
nearby
Bouvet
Island
(
Cooke
and
Hays
,
1982
;
Smith
et
al.
,
1983
)
.
Carried
to
the
east
by
prevailing
winds
,
ash
then
settles
on
ice
shelves
in
the
Weddell
Sea
and
on
seasonal
sea
ice
,
which
acts
as
a
conveyor
of
ash
to
the
South
Atlantic
Ocean
during
its
seasonal
advance
and
retreat
.
The
quartz
and
other
non
—
ash
lithics
are
sourced
from
Antarctica
by
calving
of
icebergs
(
Smith
et
al.
,
1983
;
Labey
—
rie
et
al.
,
1986
)
.
The
majority
of
icebergs
originate
from
ice
shelves
such
as
those
found
in
the
Weddell
Sea
where
debris
—
rich
basal
ice
can
be
produced
by
melting
and
freezing
at
the
base
of
these
ice
shelves
(
Warnke
,
1970
;
Hulbe
,
1997
)
.
If
IRD
transport
were
exclusively
by
icebergs
,
the
relative
proportions
of
the
primary
components
,
ash
and
quartz
,
would
be
the
same
throughout
the
South
Atlantic
.
However
,
ash
is
the
dominant
component
in
Site
1094
at
53
°
S
,
whereas
quartz
is
the
dominant
component
in
core
TTN057
—
21
at
41
°
S.
Site
1094
is
situated
south
of
the
polar
front
where
cool
SST
permits
sea
—
ice
rafting
.
In
contrast
,
core
TTN057
—
21
at
41
°
S
is
situated
north
of
both
the
present
—
day
polar
front
and
the
glacial
position
of
the
polar
front
where
the
comparably
warm
SST
inhibits
sea
—
ice
rafting
(
Brathauer
and
Abelmann
,
1999
;
Kanfoush
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
Consequently
,
although
ash
is
transported
both
by
icebergs
and
by
sea
ice
,
sea
—
ice
rafting
appears
to
be
an
important
mechanism
in
the
South
Atlantic
.
Strong
glacial
—
interglacial
distinctions
occur
in
the
record
of
IRD
delivery
to
Site
1094
,
with
very
high
IRD
levels
during
the
glacial
periods
and
very
low
levels
during
the
interglacial
periods
(
Figs
.
6
and
7
)
.
The
increase
in
IRD
during
glacials
may
be
due
to
increased
production
of
icebergs
,
increased
survival
of
icebergs
and
sea
ice
,
or
dilution
by
biogenic
material
.
During
the
last
glaciation
when
sea
level
was
~
120
m
lower
than
today
,
peripheral
ice
shelves
around
Antarctica
were
more
extensive
as
grounding
lines
advanced
seaward
over
the
continental
shelf
(
Denton
and
Hughes
,
1983
;
Bindschadler
et
al.
,
1998
)
.
Expansion
of
the
WAIS
during
the
glacial
period
increased
the
proportion
of
marine
—
based
ice
,
and
attendant
delivery
of
IRD
to
the
South
Atlantic
.
Additionally
,
isostatic
depression
of
the
continental
shelf
beneath
the
large
glacial
WAIS
could
render
it
susceptible
to
relative
sea
—
level
rise
and
subsequent
buoyancy
increase
and
unpinning
along
its
margins
(
Anderson
and
Thomas
,
1991
)
.
In
addition
to
the
higher
calving
rates
associated
with
increased
ice
volume
in
the
Weddell
Sea
region
,
cooler
glacial
SST
would
enhance
the
survival
and
long
—
distance
transport
of
debris
—
laden
icebergs
and
sea
ice
to

increased
,
even

Suborbital
variability
In
addition
to
well
—
deﬁned
glacial
—
interglacial
cycles
,
suborbital
variability
is
clearly
present
in
the
records
of
IRD
and
whole
—
core
physical
properties
measurements
at
Site
1094
.
For
the
last
glacial
period
,
these
prominent
events
have
been
correlated
with
IRD
layers
in
cores
situated
north
of
the
PFZ
and
have
been
interpreted
as
evidence
of
abrupt
episodes
of
instability
of
the
AIS
in
the
Weddell
Sea
region
(
Kanfoush
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
Examination
of
the
past
four
glaciations
reveals
that
,
in
addition
to
generally
high
IRD
,
each
is
characterized
by
discrete
pulses
in
IRD
delivery
to
Site
1094
that
occurred
on
millennial
timescales
(
Fig.
6
)
.
With
few
exceptions
,
the
abrupt
IRD
events
are
accompanied
by
brief
episodes
of
high
foraminifera
]
abundances
originating
from
iceberg
—
induced
upwelling
or
high
SST
(
Fig.
6
)
(
Labeyrie
et
al.
,
1986
;
Grobe
and
Mackensen
,
1992
)
.
Based
on
our
chronology
derived
from
SPECMAP
tie
points
,
the
temporal
spacing
of
discrete
peaks
in
IRD
during
MIS
6
,
MIS
8
and
MIS
11
appears
to
be
~
3
—
12
,
~
2
—
9
and
~
2
—
8
kyr
,
respectively
.
However
,
two
factors
make
it
diﬁicult
to
ascertain
if
this
differs
signiﬁcantly
from
that
observed
for
the
last
glacial
period
(
~
&
10
kyr
;
Kanfoush
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
First
,
the
IRD
ﬂuctuations
during
MIS
6
and
8
are
less
distinct
making
it
diﬁicult
to
identify
individual
events
and
,
second
,
the
chronology
is
coarse
.
We
can
,
however
,
ascertain
if
the
relationship
of
these
events
with
other
suborbital
changes
within
the
same
record
is
consistent
for
different
glacial
periods
.
For
example
,
do
the
millennial
—
scale
IRD
peaks
‘
march
’
through
the
changing
climatic
conditions
of
MIS
2
,
3
and
4
as
well
as
similar
(
unnamed
)
changes
within
MIS
6
?
Whereas
MIS
3
is
marked
by
several
rapid
518O
ﬂuctuations
,
the
variability
in
MIS
2
and
4
is
comparably
reduced
.
A
similar
pattern
occurs
in
estimated
temperatures
at
Vostok
during
the
last
glaciation
.
Millennial
—
scale
IRD
events
do
occur
during
each
of
the
three
stages
,
but
their
magnitude
and
frequency
is
greatest
during
MIS
3
.
This
is
consistent
with
McManus
et
al.
(
1999
)
who
argue
for
relative
climatic
stability
in
the
northern
hemisphere
during
full
glacial
periods
and
interglacial
periods
,
and
increased
variability
in
the
intervening
climate
states
.
As
in
the
last
glaciation
,
IRD
variability
occurs
throughout
MIS
6
.
However
,
unlike
the
last
glaciation
,
IRD
events
of
greater
magnitude
and
frequency
do
not
occur
during
the
interval
containing
numerous
rapid
8180
ﬂuctuations
.
Suborbital
variability
within
the
interglacial
periods
exists
with
less
regularity
than
the
glacial
periods
(
Fig.
7
)
.
Within
the
glacial
periods
SST
was
near
freezing
year
—
round
and
we
interpret
IRD
,
therefore
,
as
a
signal
of
iceberg
production
.
During
interglacial
periods
,
Site
1094
is
south
of
the
Polar
Front
and
north
of
the
winter
sea
—
ice
margin
.
Fluctuations
in
the
positions
of
these
boundaries
would
affect
iceberg
and
sea
—
ice
survivability
.
Therefore
,
the
controls
on
IRD
during
interglacial
periods
may
be
different
from
those
during
glacial
periods
.
Each
of
the
last
ﬁve
interglacial
periods
begins
similarly
,
marked
by
an
IRD
—
free
interval
with
abundant
foraminifera
occurring
at
a
time
when
temperature
over
Antarctica
is
high
(
Figs
.
4
and
7
)
.
Following
this
,
each
interglacial
is
characterized
by
a
return
to
more
glacial
conditions
,
or
a
‘
neoglaciation
’
in
which
ice
—
rafting
resumes
abruptly
and
ﬂuctuates
irregularly
while
foraminiferal
abundances
decline
(
Kirby
et
al.
,
1998
;
Brachﬁeld
and
Banerjee
,
2000
;
Yoon
,
2000
)
.
The
nature
of
the
hypsithermal
,
however
,
differs
among
the
interglacial
periods
.
Previous
studies
have
postulated
that
MIS
11
was
the
warmest
interglacial
period
of
the
late
Pleistocene
(
Oppo
et
al.
,
1990
;
Hodell
,
1993
)
.
In
contrast
,
the
planktonic
5180
minimum
of
MIS
11
at
Site
1094
remained
heavier
than
minimum
values
observed
in
MIS
9
and
5e
which
suggests
,
all
other
factors
being
equal
,
that
SST
in
the
southeast
Atlantic
were
not
signiﬁcantly
warmer
during
MIS
11
342
S.L.
Kanfoush
et
al.
/
Palaeogeograp/zy
,
Palaeoclimatalogy
,
Palaeaecology
182
(
2002
)
329
—
349
compared
to
the
subsequent
interglacial
stages
(
Hodell
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
Although
not
unique
with
respect
to
the
magnitude
of
its
SST
,
the
MIS
11
hypsithermal
exhibited
relatively
IRD-free
conditions
a
a
that
appear
to
have
persisted
for
a
substantially
longer
period
of
time
than
observed
in
the
later
interglacial
periods
.
Our
age
model
,
derived
from
correlation
to
SPECMAP
,
is
admittedly
coarse
,
particularly
during
MIS
11
(
Fig.
2
)
.
However
,
based
upon
this
chronology
,
indicators
of
ice
—
rafting
to
the
southeast
Atlantic
appear
to
have
remained
near
zero
for
more
than
30
kyr
,
compared
to
~
5
—
15
kyr
in
the
hypsithermal
intervals
of
subsequent
interglacial
periods
.
Such
particularly
IRD-free
interval
implies
diminished
calving
or
size
of
the
ice
sheet
or
both
(
McManus
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
The
duration
of
sustained
IRD
—
free
conditions
at
Site
1094
may
be
due
to
orbital
conﬁguration
.
Eccentricity
at
MIS
11
was
low
and
the
amplitude
of
the
precession
cycle
was
damped
with
the
result
that
fewer
cold
substages
punctuated
the
interglacial
(
Hodell
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
The
nature
of
the
neoglaciation
also
differs
among
the
interglacial
periods
.
Although
the
two
youngest
interglacial
periods
(
MIS
5
and
1
)
and
MIS
9
and
11
were
marked
by
a
resumption
of
ice-rafting
,
delivery
of
IRD
remained
low
relative
to
those
of
the
glacial
periods
.
In
contrast
,
the
neoglaciation
of
MIS
7
exhibits
IRD
concentrations
approaching
values
typical
of
full
glacial
periods
.
The
8180
during
MIS
7
increased
concomitantly
with
the
IRD
.
Again
,
this
difference
between
the
interglacial
periods
is
likely
a
reﬂec
—
tion
of
the
different
orbital
conﬁgurations
of
each
(
Fig.
10
)
.
Precession
is
large
during
MIS
7
with
the
result
that
the
magnitude
of
cold
substages
is
much
stronger
.
Millennial
—
scale
variability
on
termination
I
is
characterized
by
a
reversal
to
cooler
temperatures
or
the
so
—
called
Antarctic
Cold
Reversal
(
ACR
)
(
Jouzel
et
al.
,
1987
)
.
In
the
Site
1094
record
,
the
ACR
is
marked
by
greater
8180
values
and
brief
,
but
prominent
pulse
in
IRD
delivery
to
the
core
site
(
Fig.
8
)
(
Kanfoush
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
IRD
within
the
ACR
is
comprised
of
two
rapid
peaks
in
quartz
,
the
younger
of
which
is
accompanied
by
a
single
large
peak
in
ash
.
Termination
V
is
the
only
other
glacial
termination
punctuated
by
a
pronounced
quartz
peak
.
The
rate
of
IRD
decrease
across
the
terminations
differs
also
,
with
a
gradual
,
step
—
wise
decrease
across
terminations
I
and
V
and
an
abrupt
decrease
across
terminations
II
and
IV
.
In
each
case
,
however
,
concentrations
of
IRD
decrease
very
early
in
the
terminations
with
values
approaching
zero
well
prior
to
the
end
of
each
glacial
termination
.
Estimates
of
SST
derived
from
diatoms
in
Site
1094
sediments
indicate
that
substantial
warming
of
South
Atlantic
surface
waters
and
reduction
of
sea
—
ice
occurred
early
in
terminations
I
and
V
(
Kunz
—
Pirung
and
Gersonde
,
this
volume
;
Shemesh
et
al.
,
submitted
)
.
Consequently
,
high
biosi
—
liceous
productivity
may
have
led
to
dilution
of
IRD
delivered
to
Site
1094
sediments
.
In
addition
,
SST
increase
early
in
the
termination
may
have
decreased
survivability
and
transport
distances
of
debris
—
laden
icebergs
resulting
in
a
decrease
in
IRD
delivery
to
Site
1094
early
in
the
termination
.
The
brief
reversal
to
cooler
SST
associated
with
the
ACR
may
have
caused
an
expansion
of
sea
ice
and
increased
survivability
of
icebergs
,
both
of
which
may
have
increased
IRD
concentrations
in
sediments
at
Site
1094
.
If
SST
increase
is
responsible
for
the
reduction
in
IRD
delivery
to
Site
1094
during
glacial
terminations
,
the
gradual
,
step
—
wise
IRD
decrease
across
terminations
I
and
V
implies
SST
increase
occurred
in
a
gradual
,
step
—
wise
manner
.
In
contrast
,
the
abrupt
IRD
decrease
early
in
terminations
II
and
IV
suggests
SST
increase
was
abrupt
and
began
early
in
the
terminations
.

We
propose
that
Site

at

can
be
correlated
to
the
Vostok
ice
core
using
sodium
concentration
in
Vostok
and
percent

in

because
both

This

Similarly

radiolarians
strongly
dominate
the
coarse
sediment
fraction
and
both
are
related
to
sea
—
ice

at

1094
.
Ash
is
transported
in
part
by
sea
ice
,
and
sea

ice
cover
inhibits
radiolarian
productivity
(
Keany

,
1976
;
Smith
et
al.
,
1983
;
Gersonde
and
Zielinski
,

)
.
Consequently
,
as
sea
—
ice
cover
increases
,
percent
ash
increases
and
radiolarian
abundance
falls
.
We
elected
to
use
percent
ash
to
correlate
the
Site
1094
record
to
Vostok
,
but
could
have
used
percent
radiolaria
as
it
is
essentially
the
inverse
of
the
percent
ash
signal
(
Fig.

)
.
The
correlation
yields
close
agreement
between
changes
in
Vostok
—
inferred
temperature
and
8180
of
the
marine
record
on
both
orbital
and
millennial
timescales
(
Fig.

)
.
On
glacial
—
interglacial
timescales
,
regional
atmospheric
temperature
controls
changes
in
ice
—
rafting
via
its
inﬂuence
on
SST
and
,
hence
,
survivorship
and
transport
distances
of
sea
ice
and
icebergs
.
Reconstructions

.
Dominated
by
quartz
,
the
IRD
of
the
late
Holocene
differs
in
composition
relative
to
that
of
the
previous
interglacials
and
the
majority
of
the
record
(
which
is
dominated
by
ash
)
.
Termination
V
is
punctuated
by
a
brief
but
large
peak
in
quartz
and
is
the
only
other
instance
in
which
quartz
is
dominant
.
One
possible
explanation
is
a
difference
in
provenance
.
However
,
for
the
Holocene
,
the
correlation
to
Vostok
suggests
this
may
result
from
SST
too
warm
to
allow
signiﬁcant
sea
—
ice
rafting
of
ash
.
Similarly
,
estimates
of
SST
derived
from
diatoms
in
Site
1094
sediments
indicate
that
substantial
warming
of
South
Atlantic
surface
waters
and
reduction
of
sea
ice
occurred
in
termination
V
(

—

)
.
Resumption
of
IRD
delivery
to
Site

in
the
late
Holocene
occurs
when
inferred
temperature
at
Vostok
remains
warm
(
>
~
o
°
C
)
and
5180
remains
relatively
unchanged
.
Ice

rafting
to

resumes
during
MIS
5
even
before
the
end
of
the
Eemian
following
an
essentially
IRD
—
free
interval
.
Similar
to
the
Holocene
,
the
ﬁrst
neogla
—
cial
IRD
peak
during
the
Eemian
occurs
while
inferred
temperature
at
Vostok
is
~
o

C
.
However
,
it
does
follow
a
rapid
drop
in
temperature

from

(

)
.
During
MIS
11
,
IRD

increases
while
8180
remains
relatively
unchanged
,
however
temperature
at
Vostok
has
decreased
substantially
by
this
time
(
from
more
than
+2
°
C
to
less
than
—
4
°
C
)
.
In
MIS
7
and
9
,
the
neoglaciation
corresponds
to
substantially
heavier
5180
values
and
cooler
Vostok
temperatures
(
less
than
~
—
3.5
to
—
4.0
°
C
)
that
likely
enhanced
long
—
distance
transport
of
sea
ice
.
The
record
of
IRD
concentration
exhibits
broad
similarities
with
the
dust
record
in
Vostok
(
Fig.
12
)
.
There
is
similarity
on
timescales
somewhat
intermediate
between
orbital
and
suborbital
.
Glacial
—
interglacial
patterns
are
clearly
evident
in
each
and
some
(
but
not
all
)
of
the
millennial
—
scale
events
match
.
High
dust
concentrations
during
glacial
periods
reﬂect
continental
aridity
,
dust
mobilization
and
transport
,
whereas
the
presence
of
larger
particles
indicates
more
turbulent
atmospheric
circulation
in
the
high
southern
latitudes
(
Petit
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
Petit
et
al.
(

)
suggested
that
peaks

to
periods
of
steepened
winter
ocean
—
Antarctica
temperature
gradient
resulting
from
expansion
of
sea
ice
in
the
South
Atlantic
.
The
general
correspondence
of
percent
ash
with
dust
in
Vostok
may
be
explained
by
sea
—
ice
expansion
because
ash
is
rafted
,
in
part
,
by
sea
ice
(
Keany
et
al.
,
1976
;
Smith
et
al.
,
1983
)
.
Quartz
,
which
is
not
dominantly
rafted
by
sea
ice
,
also
exhibits
a
similar
broad
—
scale
correspondence
with
dust
.
This
may
be
explained
by
increased
iceberg
survivorship
and
transport
distances
at
times
when
SST
are
cool
enough
to
permit
sea
—
ice
expansion
.
The
MS
and
GRA
bulk
densities
,
which
approximate
the
IRD

,
show
a
corresponding
degree
of
similarity
with
the

and

(
Grousset

Basile
et

.
The

,
therefore
,
is
dominated
by

reﬂect

Other

eolian

Conclusions
(
1
)
The
whole
—
core
measurements
of
sediment
physical
properties
,
MS
and
GRA
bulk
density
,
displayed
much
(
but
not
all
)
of
the
variability
present
within
the
visually
determined
IRD
record
for
both
glacial
and
interglacial
periods
.
Consequently
,
for
Site
1094
,
and
likely
others
situated
south
of
the
present
—
day
PFZ
where
sedimentation
is
controlled
by
similar
processes
,
these
parameters
are
to
a
limited
extent
a
proxy
of
IRD
.
Weight
percent
>
150
yielded
the
best
estimate
of
IRD
.
The
NGR
signal
is
not
a
proxy
for
IRD
but
rather
exhibited
strong
similarity
with
the
record
of
dust
concentration
in
Vostok
on
millennial
timescales
.

Suborbital
variability
in
ice
—
rafting
at
Site
1094
characterizes
glacial
periods
and
interglacial
periods
of
the
late
Pleistocene
.
Millennial
—
scale
pulses
in
IRD
delivery
to
the
South
Atlantic
,
interpreted
as
episodes
of
instability
of
the
AIS
,
occurred
during
each
of
the
last
four
glacial
periods
(
MIS
241
,
MIS
6
,
MIS
8
and
MIS
10
)
.
Variability
within
each
of
the
last
ﬁve
interglacial
periods
(
the
Holocene
,
MIS
5
,
MIS
7
,
MIS
9
and
MIS
11
)
includes
an
early
hypsithermal
period
characterized
by
low
IRD
,
MS
and
GRA
bulk
density
and
high
foraminiferal
abundance
and
percent
reﬂectance
.
A
reversal
of
these
conditions
characterized
the
latter
parts
of
the
interglacial
periods
and
is
interpreted
as
a
return
to
more
glacial
conditions
,
a
neoglaciation
.
(

)
Suborbital
variability
in
ice
—
rafting
at
Site
1094
differs
among
glacial
periods
and
among
interglacial
periods
.
Thus
,
the
nature
(
magnitude
,
frequency
,
perhaps
even
composition
)
of
IRD
peaks
is
to
some
extent
dependent
upon
orbital
conﬁguration
.
Within
the
limitations
of
our
chronology
,
the
duration
of
hypsithermal
conditions
appears
to
have
been
greater
for
MIS
11
than
other
interglacial
periods
of
the
late
Pleistocene
.
The
neoglaciations
of
MIS
7
and
9
were
associated
with
a
substantial
increase
in
8180
;
however
,
the
neoglaciation
of
MIS
5
began
prior
to
the
end
of
the
Eemian
and
was
accompanied
by
only
a
modest
increase
in
5180
.
Oxygen
isotopic
values
during
the
late
Holocene
neoglaciation
are
unchanged
.
Precession
is
large
during
MIS
7
with
the
result
that
the
magnitude
of
cold
substages
was
much
larger
and
ice
—
rafting
more
abundant
than
in
other
interglacial
periods
of
the
past
420000
years
.
(

)
We
postulate
percent
ash
in
the
marine
sediment
record
from
Site
1094
and
sodium
concentration
in
the
Vostok
ice
core
are
both
controlled
by
areal
extent
of
sea
ice
.
They
,
therefore
,
provided
a
means
for
correlation
between
the
South
Atlantic
sediments
and
Antarctic
ice
at
resolution
suﬁicient
to
examine
the
phasing
of
marine
and
atmospheric
changes
on
millennial
scales
.
NGR
exhibits
similarities
with
dust
concentration
in
Vostok
.
One
possible
explanation
is
that
it
is
attributed
to
periods
of
vigorous
atmospheric
circulation
resulting
from
steepened
ocean
—
Antarctica
thermal
gradients
associated
with
sea
—
ice
expansion
.
Peaks
in
IRD
also
show
broad
—
scale
(
on
timescales
somewhat
intermediate
between
Milankovitch
and
suborbital
)
similarities
with
Vostok
dust
and
likely
reﬂect
enhanced
sea
—
ice
and
iceberg
survivability
in
cooler
SST
at
times
of

expansion
.
