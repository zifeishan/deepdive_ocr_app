A
functional
multivariate
analysis
of
Mesopithecus
(
Primates
:
Colobinae
)
humeri
from
the
Turolian
of
Greece
Abstract
The
genus
Mesopithecus
is
well
represented
in
the
late
Miocene
of
Greece
by
several
recognized
species
.
The
present
paper
investigates
functional
aspects
of
the
humeri
of
Mesopithecus
delsoni
/
pentelicus
,
M.
pentelicus
and
M.
aff
.
pentelicus
of
several
Turolian
sites
from
central
and
northern
Greece
,
using
multivariate
approaches
.
For
these
purposes
,
we
selected
significant
humeral
functional
features
,
which
were
represented
by
23
linear
dimensions
and
three
angles
on
14
fossil
humeri
and
104
humeri
from
10
genera
and
22
species
of
extant
African
and
Asian
Colobines
.
All
size-adjusted
measurements
were
examined
through
a
principal
components
analysis
,
followed
by
a
discriminant
function
analysis
,
and
a
canonical
variates
analysis
.
All
analyses
revealed
that
the
selected
characters
were
able
to
discriminate
between
extant
colobine
genera
.
Functional
groups
,
such
as
arboreal
walking/climbing
,
arboreal
walking/suspensory
and
semi-terrestrial
walking
,
were
set
apart
from
a
central
cluster
formed
by
the
arboreal
walking
and
arboreal
walking/terrestrial
groups
.
This
cluster
also
grouped
the
three
studied
Mesopithecus
species
,
which
were
mainly
classified
as
arboreal
walkers
with
significant
terrestrial
activities
.
These
observations
match
with
paleoenvironmental
reconstructions
and
the
suggested
opportunistic
feeding
habits
.
Moreover
,
the
overall
arboreal/terrestrial
locomotor
tendencies
of
these
fossil
forms
are
discussed
in
relation
to
their
earlier
migration
from
Africa
and
later
dispersal
to
eastern
and
southern
Asia
.

Introduction
The
Eurasian
colobine
genus
Mesopithecus
Wagner
,
1839
is
known
from
numerous
cranial
,
dental
,
and
postcranial
specimens
from
many
Eurasian
late
Miocene
to
late
Pliocene
sites
(
8.7
–
3
Ma
[
millions
of
years
ago
]
)
,
representing
several
different
species
(

Mesopithecus
appears
to
bear
close
affinities
to
Asian
colobines
(

;
Pan

al.
,

)
,
but
the
primitive
nature
of
its
characters
still
classifies
it
as
Colobinae
incertae
sedis
(
Szalay
and
Delson
,
1979
;
Strasser
and
Delson
,

)
.
Its
basal
position
within
the
Colobinae
,
or
more
likely
within
the
Asian
clade
,
as
well
as
its
geographic
expansion
from
western
Europe
to
China
(

,
makes
Mesopithecus
and
its
phylogenetic
and
paleobiological
reconstruction
fundamental
to
interpreting
the
evolutionary
diversification
of
Asian
colobines
.
Mesopithecus
in
Greece
is
known
from
rich
fossil
material
,
attributed
to
several
intermediate
forms
or
time-successive
morphospecies
,
which
span
the
whole
of
the
Turolian
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Previous
work
attempted
to
reconstruct
substrate
preferences
of
these
forms
based
on
uni
-
and
multivariate
analyses
of
several
postcranial
functional
characters
(

.
Thus
,
the
middle
Turolian
Mesopithecus
delsoni
/

from
Perivolaki
(

was
interpreted
as
a
terrestrial/semi-terrestrial
monkey
(

varied
from
arboreal
(

,
to

.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
late
Turolian
intermediate
form
M.
aff
.
pentelicus
(
previously
M.
cf.
pentelicus
)
from
Dytiko-3
(

Koufos
et
al.

has
also
been
reconstructed
as
a
mainly
semi-terrestrial
monkey
with
possible
equal
use
of
both
terrestrial
and
arboreal
substrates
(
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,

)
.
Following
a
similar
line
of
research
,
the
present
report
considers
the
functional
morphology
of
humeral
characters
,
aiming
to
validate
previous
positional
inferences
and
trace
the
evolutionary
diversity
of
locomotor
behaviors
within
the
genus
throughout
the
Turolian
of
Greece
.
The
humerus
is
critical
in
interpreting
locomotor
and
postural
adaptations
,
as
it
lies
between
the
shoulder
and
elbow
joints
that
determine
forelimb
movements
and
position
in
relation
to
various
supports
.
Thus
many
features
of
the
proximal
humerus
,
such
as
the
shape
and
positioning
of
the
tuberosities
and
associated
muscular
attachments
and
the
form
of
the
humeral
head
,
strongly
reflect
the
range
of
shoulder
movements
that
are
important
in
reconstructing
fine
grade
locomotor
patterns
(

Frost
and
Delson
,

;
Ruff
,
2002
;
Wright
et
al.
,
2007
;
Ingicco
,
2008
)
.
In
addition
,
the
morphology
of
the
shaft
and
related
muscular
insertions
reveal
stress
frequency
,
direction
and
intensity
that
are
functionally
associated
with
patterns
of
forelimb
movements
upon
various
supports
(
Conroy
,
1976

Szalay
and
Dagosto

1980

and

;

,
1996
;
Jablonski
et
al.
,
2002
;
Ruff
,

)
.
Finally
,
distal
humeral
morphology
also
reflects
the
range
of
both
fore-aft
and
rotatory
mobility
of
the
elbow
and
forearm
,
which
is
important
for
inferring
movements
and
placement
of
the
forelimb
(

The
current
study
examines
functional
aspects
of
the
fossil
humeri
of
M.
delsoni
/
pentelicus
,
M.
pentelicus
,
and
M.
aff
.
pentelicus
using
multivariate
approaches
that
enable
thorough
discrimination
of
functional
groups
related
to
locomotor
and
substrate
preferences
.
The
inference
of
similar
positional
patterns
for
these
forms
will
provide
evidence
for
the
evolution
of
locomotor
behavior
and
paleoecology
of
the
genus
in
the
late
Miocene
in
Greece
and
can
be
related
to
its
earlier
migration
from
Africa
and
later
dispersal
to
eastern
and
southern
Asia
.
Materials
and
methods
Materials
The
fossil
material
consisted
of
14
humeri
of
the
three
different
species
of
Mesopithecus
from
three
different
institutions
(
Table
1
)
.
For
comparative
purposes
,
we
examined
the
humeri
of
104
recent
Colobinae
representing
ten
genera
and
22
species
(
Table
2
)
,
following
the
taxonomy
proposed
by
Groves
(
2001
)
.
In
order
to
avoid
ontogenetic
effects
,
all
extant
specimens
belonged
to
adult
wild-shot
individuals
and
were
housed
in
the
collections
of
the
Laboratoire
d'Anatomie
Comparée
,
Muséum
National
d’Histoire
Naturelle
,
Paris
,
France
;
the
Mammal
Collections
,
Department
of
Zoology
,
Natural

London
,
UK
;
and
Division
of
Mammals
,
National
Museum
of
Natural
History
,
Smithsonian
Institution
,
Washington
,
DC
,
USA
.
Due
to
the
small
sample
sizes
for
some
species
,
male
and
female
specimens
were
pooled
,
even
in
the
case
of
pronounced
sexual
dimorphism
.
Regarding
the
studied
genera
,
CV1
mainly
separated
the
odd-nosed
group
with
negative
scores
,
and
the
African
colobines
with
positive
scores
(
Fig.
3
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
group
of
langurs
and
leaf
monkeys
was
clearly
separated
on
CV2
.
The
Mesopithecus
specimens
were
placed
near
the
axes
centre
and
very
close
to
the
Trachypithecus
species
(
Fig.
3
)
.
Locomotion
The
initial
MANOVA
on
the
26
variables
with
locomotor
type
as
a
factor
indicated
that
intergroup
variance
was
larger
than
the
intragroup
variance
(
F
=
1.67
,
p
<
0.001
)
.
Subsequently
,
a
DFA
was
carried
out
to
emphasize
morphological
differences
between
locomotor
types
,
as
well
as
to
define
a
model
for
the
allocation
of
Mesopithecus
within
the
predefined
groupings
.
The
studied
extant
specimens
are
illustrated
by
both
type
of
locomotion
(
Fig.
4
a
)
and
genus
(
Fig.
4
b
)
.
The
following
CVA
,
grouping
by
locomotor
type
,
retained
two
CVs
expressing
65
%
and
21
%
of
total
variation
,
respectively
.
Size
was
not
significantly
correlated
with
CV1
(
F
=
0.63
,
p
=
0.374
)
but
was
correlated
with
CV2
(
F
=
9.87
,
p
=
0.003
)
,
even
if
the
r
-
value
was
rather
low
(
r
=
0.294
)
.
Loadings
on
CV1
were
positive
and
high
for
Humerus
Length
,
Olecranon
Fossa
Height
,
Trochlea
Width
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
,
Humeral

(

)
.
In
contrast
,
Trochlea

,
Trochlea

,
Humeral

,
and
Deltopectoral

had
the
higher

)
.
Loadings

,

,
and
slightly
less
for
Deltopectoral
Crest
Height
and
Deltopectoral

Distal
Point
(
Table

)
.
Regarding
locomotor
types
,
CV1
appeared
to
discriminate
Arboreal
Walkers
Suspensory
(
AWS
)
with
positive
scores
,
from
Arboreal
Walkers
Climbers
(
AWC
)
showing
negative
scores
(
Fig.
4
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
CV2
showed
a
slight
discrimination
between
the
more
arboreally
adapted
forms
(
AWS
and
AWC
)
with
high
and
positive
scores
,
from
the
Arboreal
Terrestrial
Walkers
(
ATW
)
with
high
and
negative
scores
(
Fig.
4
)
.
In
general
,
locomotor
type
groups
displayed
high
percentages
of
correct
classifications
.
This
was
particularly
evident
for
the
ATW
and
AWS
groups
(
95.7
%
and
92.0
%
,
respectively
)
.
The
percentage
was
slightly
lower
for
AWC
(
87.5
%
)
and
even
less
for
the
two
overlapping
AW
(
75.0
%
)
and
AWT
(
77.5
%
)
groups
.
The
fossil
specimens
of
Mesopithecus
seemed
to
be
placed
close
to
Arboreal
Walking-Terrestrial
(
AWT
)
and
Arboreal
Walking
(
AW
)
species
,
which
exhibit
variable
degrees
of
arboreality
within
their
locomotor
profiles
,
and
approximated
the
position
of
Trachypithecus
species
(
Fig.
4
)
.
A
closer
look
showed
a
relatively
compound
cluster
mainly
formed
by
M.
pentelicus
that
enclosed
the
other
two
intermediate
forms
(
Fig.
5
)
.
The
DFA
results
were
used
as
a
model
for
predicting
allocation
of
the
three
forms
to
one
or
another
locomotor
group
.
Posterior
probabilities
inferences
are
given
for
each
Mesopithecus
specimen
and
presented
in
Table
5
.
The
single
specimen
of
M
.
aff
.
pentelicus
(
DKO-67
)
was
classified
as
an
Arboreal
Walker
with
Terrestrial
activities
(
AWT
)
with
a
high
probability
(
Fig.
5
,
Table
5
)
.
Morphologically
,
it
was
characterized
by
an
enlarged
biepicondylar
width
,
a
proximodistally
high
and
anteroposteriorly
deep
trochlea
,
a
high
and
deep
olecranon
fossa
and
an
enlarged
globular
capitulum
(
Fig.
7
c
)
.
M.
delsoni
/
pentelicus
,
from
Perivolaki
(
PER-202
)
,
was
also
classified
as
an
Arboreal
Walker
with
Terrestrial
activities
(
AWT
)
with
an
equally
high
probability
(
Fig.
5
,
Table
5
)
.
The
specimen
from
Vathylakos
(
VTK-63
)
was
classified
into
the
Arboreal
Walker
group
(
AW
)
with
a
low
posterior
probability
(
69.7
%
)
,
but
also
on
the
limit
of
the
confidence
intervals
of
the
AWS
and
AWT
groups
(
Fig.
5
)
.
Morphologically
,
M.
delsoni
/
pentelicus
was
characterized
by
an
ovoid
humeral
head
with
pronounced
tuberosities
placed
at
an
intermediate
humeral
angle
,
a
relatively
robust
shaft
with
well-developed
deltopectoral
crest
,
a
comparably
high
and
deep
olecranon
fossa
,
and
an
anteroposteriorly
deep
and
proximodistally
high
trochlea
(
Figs.
6
a
and
7
a
)
.
The
majority
of
M
.
pentelicus
specimens
were
classified
into
the
Arboreal
Walker
with
Terrestrial
activities
(
AWT
)
locomotion
type
(
Fig.
5
)
.
More
precisely
,
three
specimens
were
well
classified
as
ATW
(
Table
5
)
,
two
as
Arboreal
Walkers
(
AW
)
,
only
one
as
Arboreal
Walker/Climber
(
AWC
)
,
and
the
rest
five
as
AWT
(
Table
5
)
.
However
,
it
was
not
statistically
possible
to
distinguish
between
the
locomotor
attributions
of
the
three
forms
,
underscoring
the
important
part
of
terrestriality
in
the
locomotion
of
Mesopithecus
.
In
terms
of
anatomy
,
M.
pentelicus
possessed
a
modestly
high
humeral
head
with
less
developed
tuberosities
,
a
relatively
robust
shaft
,
a
high
and
deep
olecranon
fossa
,
and
an
anteroposteriorly
deep
and
proximodistally
high
trochlea
with
a
distally
protruding
medial
rim
(
Figs.
6
b
and
7
b
)
.
Discussion
and
conclusions
Positional
activities
are
strongly
related
to
habitat
use
as
they
provide
access
to
food
sources
,
promote
social
activities
,
and
enable
escape
from
predators
.
For
extinct
species
,
it
is
therefore
important
to
reconstruct
aspects
of
locomotion
and
postures
to
understand
their
paleobiology
.
This
procedure
requires
the
use
of
fossil
postcranial
characters
that
can
be
robustly
associated
with
regional
functions
,
which
in
turn
suggest
specific
limb
movements
involved
in
frequent
or
critical
locomotor
or
postural
modes
.
In
this
context
,
the
current
study
used
selected
humeral
functional
features
of
extant
colobines
and
three
Mesopithecus
fossil
species
from
Greece
.
The
studied
features
enabled
successful
separation
between
different
functional/locomotor
groups
,
which
is
crucial
for
any
attempt
of
positional
reconstruction
of
any
fossil
form
.
These
groups
actually
consisted
of
the
relatively
derived
arboreal
climbing
,
arboreal
suspensory
,
and
mainly
terrestrial
forms
.
Species
with
intermediate
profiles
,
sharing
both
arboreal
and
terrestrial
activities
in
variable
rates
,
were
mainly
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
multivariate
space
of
our
analyses
.
Thus
,
arboreal
walking/climbing
forms
(
AWC
)
formed
a
quite
heterogeneous
group
that
was
relatively
distinct
.
This
group
was
characterized
by
an
acute
humeral
head
angle
,
a
relatively
globular
humeral
head
,
a
prominent
deltopectoral
crest
,
comparatively
wide
and
low
trochlea
,
and
a
relatively
well-developed
medial
epicondyle
directed
postero-medially
(
Figs.
6
f
and
7
g
)
.
Functionally
,
these
features
suggest
fairly
ample
movements
in
the
shoulder
joint
,
a
powerfully
partially
flexed
arm
,
and
an
elbow
joint
that
favors
a
partly
flexed
forearm
with
moderate
prono-supination
(

,
1972

,
1989
;
Gebo
and
Sargis
,
1994
;
Egi
et
al.
,

)
.
Although
this
group
was
relatively
cohesive
,
more
detailed
field
studies
of
both
African
and
Asian
colobines
are
required
to
determine
actual
rates
of
climbing
and
clambering
behavior
.
Similar
research
will
provide
a
more
robust
background
for
similar
morpho-functional
associations
to
interpret
extant
and
fossil
colobine
morphology
.
Towards
a
more
arboreal
condition
,
arboreal
walking/suspensory
forms
(
AWS
)
were
also
very
well
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
studied
colobines
.
This
functional
group
was
composed
of
the
odd-nosed
genera
Nasalis
,
Pygathrix
,
and
Simias
.
This
finding
further
supports
the
highly
derived
nature
of
this
southeast
Asian
colobine
group
,
as
also
supported
by
both
morphological
and
molecular
data
(

but

.
The
group
was
morphologically
associated
with
a
large
globular
head
,
enlarged
subscapularis
facet
,
long
shaft
,
extended
biepicondylar
width
,
medial
condyle
directed
more
medially
,
and
wide
and
low
trochlea
and
capitulum
(

.
This
group
was
differentiated
from
the
arboreal
climbers
,
by
their
larger
head
,
extended
subscapularis
facet
,
longer
shaft
,
extended
biepicondylar
width
and
more
medial
direction
of
the
medial
epicondyle
.
Functionally
,
these
features
seem
to
accommodate
extended
arm
movements
at
the
shoulder
level
,
favor
a
partially
extended
elbow
,
and
promote
frequent
forearm
prono-supination
(

.
Similar
movements
occur
frequently
in
forelimb
dominated
positional
activities
,
such
as
arm
swing
,
brachiation
or
vertical
climb
that
are
common
in
these
monkeys
(

and
Covert
,

;
Workman
and
Covert
,

et

)
.
From
this
phylogenetic
group
,
only
Rhinopithecus
differentiated
,
showing
a
humeral
morphology
related
to
arboreal/terrestrial
quadrupedal
activities
and
was
placed
in
the
center
of
the
axes
(
Fig.
4
b
)
.
This
finding
may
further
underscore
its
divergent
nature
(
Li
et
al.
,
2001
,
2004
)
,
distinctive
morphology
(
Davison
,
1982
;
Pan
and
Oxnard
,
2001
;
Pan
et
al.
,

;
Su
and
Jablonski
,

)
and
semi-terrestrial
behaviors
(
Wu
,
1993
;
Isler
and
Grüter
,
2006
;
Li
,
2007
;
Su
and
Jablonski
,
2009
)
.
Towards
the
more
terrestrial
side
of
the
spectrum
,
Semnopithecus
entellus
was
well
distinguished
from
the
main
bulk
(
ATW
)
.
This
highly
diversified
colobine
(
Osterholz
et
al.
,
2008
)
seems
to
effectively
share
arboreal
and
terrestrial
quadrupedal
and
leaping
activities
(
Ripley
,
1967
)
.
The
more
terrestrial
quadrupedal
commitment
of
the
larger
forms
was
morphologically
reflected
on
the
robustness
of
the
humeral
shaft
,
and
the
high
,
narrow
and
deep
trochlea
and
capitulum
with
well
defined
rims
,
the
high
and
deep
olecranon
fossa
and
the
posteriorly
directed
short
medial
condyle
(
Figs.
6
c
and
7
d
)
that
assure
sagittal
fore-aft
forelimb
movements
and
resistance
to
high
reaction
forces
from
the
ground
or
larger
supports
(
Gabis
,
1960
;
Olivier
and
Soutoul
,
1960
;
Jolly
,
1967
,
1972
;
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
;
Rose
,
1988
,
1993
;
Jablonski
et
al.
,
2002
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
arboreal
walking
(
AW
)
and
arboreal
walking/terrestrial
(
AWT
)
colobines
were
intertwined
together
in
the
center
of
the
axes
,
accompanied
by
most
Mesopithecus
specimens
,
with
some
of
the
latter
approaching
the
more
terrestrial
group
.
Although
the
three
studied
fossil
forms
were
functionally
attributed
to
different
groups
,
they
were
statistically
inseparable
and
basically
within
the
arboreal
walking
and
arboreal
walking
with
terrestrial
activities
clusters
.
Thus
,
the
functional
humeral
features
of
M.
delsoni
/
pentelicus
from
the
middle
Turolian
of
Vathylakkos
and
Perivolaki
suggest
a
humerus
similar
to
those
of
monkeys
that
move
mainly
quadrupedally
on
arboreal
supports
,
as
well
as
on
the
ground
.
More
precisely
,
the
older
specimen
from
Vathylakkos
(
VTK-63-R
)
appeared
to
bear
similarities
to
more
arboreal
quadrupedal
species
,
such
as
Presbytis
(
e.g.
,
Fleagle
,
1978
)
,
while
the
slightly
younger
specimen
from
Perivolaki
,
was
more
similar
to
the
mainly
arboreal
but
somewhat
more
terrestrially
adapted
Trachypithecus
(
e.g.
,
Xiong
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
The
associated
humeral
morphology
,
which
included
a
relatively
robust
humeral
shaft
,
a
comparatively
deep
and
high
olecranon
fossa
,
a
relatively
medially
high
capitulum
and
a
relatively
deep
and
high
trochlea
,
also
denotes
these
tendencies
.
The
relatively
robust
humerus
is
characteristic
of
more
terrestrially
adapted
colobines
(
Su
and
Jablonski
,
2009
)
,
and
helps
withstand
relatively
high
reaction
forces
that
occur
in
touchdown
during
quadrupedal
walking
and
running
on
large
arboreal
supports
and
on
the
ground
(
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
;
Godfrey
,
1988
;
Jablonski
et
al.
,
2002
;
Ruff
,
2002
)
.
In
a
similar
manner
,
the
relatively
deep
and
high
olecranon
fossa
can
accommodate
a
robust
olecranon
that
maintains
integrity
and
stability
of
the
elbow
joint
during
locomotion
with
an
extended
and
pronated
forelimb
(
Jolly
,
1967
,
1972
;
Jenkins
,
1973
;
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
;
Rose
,
1988
,
1993
;
Frost
and
Delson
,
2002
;
Egi
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
comparatively
high
and
deep
distal
articular
facets
,
with
well
defined
rims
increase
stability
during
flexion
and
extension
of
the
elbow
,
while
reducing
rotational
movements
of
the
forearm
,
characteristic
of
more
terrestrial
colobines
(
Jenkins
,
1973
;
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
;
Rose
,
1988
,
1993
;
Harrison
,
1989
;
Jablonski
et
al.
,
2002
;
Egi
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
In
addition
,
it
suggests
a
more
weight-bearing
role
that
assures
the
stability
of
the
joint
(
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
,
1995
)
.
This
morphology
apparently
permitted
M.
delsoni
/
pentelicus
to
move
at
ease
on
the
ground
,
as
well
as
to
exploit
available
relatively
large
and
mainly
horizontal
arboreal
supports
with
equal
dexterity
.
Additionally
,
the
difference
in
the
functional
attribution
for
the
two
humeri
may
imply
sexual
differences
:
the
Perivolaki
specimen
is
considered
a
female
,
while
the
Vathylakkos
humerus
belongs
to
a
male
(
Koufos
,
2009a
,
b
)
.
The
more
arboreal
reconstruction
for
the
Vathylakkos
male
specimen
may
thus
imply
possible
gender
behavioral
differences
.
This
combination
of
terrestrial
and
arboreal
habits
enables
the
utilization
of
a
relatively
open
environment
with
grasslands
,
surrounded
by
bushes
and
shrubs
,
similar
to
that
reconstructed
for
Vathylakkos
(
Bonis
et
al.
,
1992
;
Koufos
et
al.
,
2004
)
and
Perivolaki
(
Koufos
et
al.
,
2006a
)
and
comparable
with
south
Bulgarian
sites
of
the
same
age
(
Koufos
et
al.
,
2003
;
Merceron
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
This
is
partly
in
accordance
to
previous
inferences
,
which
proposed
primarily
semi-terrestrial
activities
with
limited
use
of
arboreal
substrates
(
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,
2010
)
.
A
comparable
profile
was
established
for
the
more
recent
late
middle
Turolian
M.
pentelicus
from
the
classic
locality
of
Pikermi
.
The
species
showed
a
relative
locomotor
diversity
with
forms
functionally
affiliated
to
more
arboreal
quadrupeds
and
others
to
more
arboreal/terrestrial
quadrupedal
habits
.
There
were
no
relationships
between
sex
and
locomotor
reconstruction
,
as
some
male
specimens
were
very
arboreal
(
PIK-355
)
while
others
were
more
terrestrial
(
PIK-419
,
PIK-298
)
.
The
same
was
true
for
females
,
although
they
tended
to
show
more
arboreal
tendencies
,
closer
to
AWT
and
AW
.
Similar
differences
may
actually
express
individual
locomotor
and
morphological
variation
that
occurs
within
species
,
or
may
alternately
express
difficulties
in
locomotor
reconstruction
.
In
all
cases
,
M.
pentelicus
was
statistically
classified
as
a
quadruped
utilizing
mainly
arboreal
supports
with
significant
,
but
variable
,
use
of
the
ground
.
Morphologically
,
this
was
also
evident
in
the
associated
humeral
characters
,
such
as
the
robustly
built
shaft
,
the
high
and
deep
olecranon
fossa
,
the
high
and
deep
trochlea
,
and
the
medially
high
capitulum
.
As
discussed
in
detail
above
,
such
features
seem
to
favor
resistance
to
high
reaction
forces
and
promote
overall
stability
of
the
elbow
joint
during
flexion
and
extension
movements
with
relatively
restricted
rotational
mobility
of
the
forearm
(
Jenkins
,
1973
;
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
,
1995
;
Rose
,
1988
,
1993
;
Harrison
,
1989
;
Gebo
and
Sargis
,
1994
;
Nakatsukasa
,
1994
;
Frost
and
Delson
,
2002
;
Egi
et
al.
,
2007
;
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
These
movements
facilitate
a
combination
of
both
terrestrial
and
arboreal
quadrupedal
habits
,
with
a
slight
preponderance
of
the
former
.
Based
on
these
characters
,
the
late
middle
Turolian
M.
pentelicus
could
be
reconstructed
as
a
primarily
arboreal/terrestrial
monkey
largely
conforming
to
previous
studies
(
Szalay
and
Delson
,
1979
;
Strasser
,
1988
;
Youlatos
,
1999
,
2003
;
Jablonski
,
2002
;
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,
2010
;
contra
;
Escarguel
,
2005
)
.
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
talar
features
revealed
more
arboreal
tendencies
than
the
present
study
(
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,
2010
)
and
this
may
actually
reflect
differential
biomechanical
requirements
in
the
different
skeletal
parts
under
consideration
.
Pedal
elements
need
to
accommodate
the
foot
on
respective
supports
providing
both
thrust
as
well
as
grasping
firmness
,
while
the
humerus
is
employed
in
locomotor
thrust
,
stability
,
resistance
to
applied
forces
,
and
complex
manipulations
(
Larson
,
1995
)
.
Our
predictions
further
support
reconstructions
of
the
paleoenvironment
of
the
locality
of
Pikermi
,
which
is
usually
considered
as
savanna-woodland
,
enriched
by
gallery
forests
(
Bonis
et
al.
,
1992
,
1999
;
contra
;
Solounias
et
al.
,
1999
)
.
The
younger
M.
aff
.
pentelicus
,
from
late
Turolian
locality
of
Dytiko-3
(
DKO
)
,
showed
affinities
to
arboreal
walking
monkeys
with
terrestrial
activities
and
was
placed
close
to
Trachypithecus
,
which
show
similar
positional
behaviors
(
e.g.
,
Xiong
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
This
form
also
exhibited
similar
humeral
features
to
most
M.
pentelicus
specimens
,
like
a
relatively
robust
humerus
,
a
deep
and
high
olecranon
fossa
,
and
relatively
deep
and
high
distal
articular
facets
that
suggest
a
weight
supporting
forelimb
,
favoring
stability
during
flexion
–
extension
and
relatively
limited
forearm
rotation
(
Jenkins
,
1973
;
Fleagle
and
Simons
,
1982
,
1995
;
Rose

,
1994
;
Egi
et
al.
,
2007
;
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
These
functional
interpretations
are
further
supported
by
reconstructions
of
late
Turolian
Dytiko
localities
as
a
patchwork
of
wooded
and
bushy
areas
with
waterholes
surrounded
by
dense
forested
areas
(
Bonis
et
al.
,
1992
,
1999
;
Merceron
et
al.
,
2005
;
Koufos
,
2006c
,
2009a
,
b
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
are
no
humeri
from
the
sympatric
and
synchronous
Mesopithecus
cf.
monpsessulanus
to
compare
with
,
and
substantiate
locomotor
reconstructions
are
based
on
the
talus
(
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,
2010
)
.
The
current
study
,
having
considered
selected
features
of
the
humerus
,
showed
that
the
radiation
of
Mesopithecus
consists
mainly
of
semi-terrestrial
monkeys
with
differential
use
of
terrestriality
.
This
was
also
the
case
with
other
crown
colobines
(
e.g.
,
Dolichopithecus
)
,
which
appear
to
be
adapted
to
a
comparably
variable
regime
of
terrestrial
habits
(
Jablonski
,
2002
;
Delson
et
al.
,
2005
;
Egi
et
al.
,
2007
;
Ingicco
,
2008
)
.
This
also
seems
to
be
the
trend
within
the
evolutionary
line
of
Mesopithecus
.
The
earliest
representative
of
the
lineage
,
the
early
Turolian
M.
delsoni
,
is
described
as
a
robustly
built
monkey
similar
to
extant
semi-terrestrial
colobines
(
Koufos
et
al.
,
2003
)
exploiting
relatively
open
and
dry
habitats
(
Bonis
et
al.
,
1992
,
1999
;
Koufos
et
al.
,
2003
)
.
The
intermediate
form
,
M.
delsoni
/
pentelicus
showed
an
analogous
profile
with
slightly
more
increased
rates
of
arboreality
(
see
also
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,
2010
)
.
Subsequently
,
the
middle
Turolian
M.
pentelicus
would
have
also
been
semi-terrestrially
adapted
,
with
considerable
but
variable
arboreal
tendencies
within
a
mixed
savanna-forest
environment
.
The
next
intermediate
form
,
M.
aff
.
pentelicus
,
was
also
a
semi-terrestrial
quadrupedal
walker
utilizing
arboreal
and
terrestrial
substrates
equally
well
(
Youlatos
and
Koufos
,
2010
)
.
Finally
,
as
the
climate
became
gradually
more
humid
through
late
Turolian
and
early
Ruscinian
,
and
forested
environments
started
spreading
through
eastern
Mediterranean
,
one
of
the
intermediate
forms
would
have
very
likely
evolved
into
the
more
gracile
semi-terrestrial
M.
monspessulanus
that
was
suitably
adapted
to
such
an
environment
(
Delson
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
The
terrestrial
–
arboreal
positional
preferences
of
Mesopithecus
,
as
reflected
on
the
available
postcranial
material
,
accord
with
dietary
inferences
for
this
colobine
.
Mesopithecus
appeared
to
have
a
diet
composed
of
a
mixture
of
fruit
supplemented
with
hard
objects
such
as
seeds
and
stems
,
similar
to
capuchins
or
savanna-dwelling
monkeys
(
Merceron
et
al.
,
2009a
,
b
)
.
The
variable
mixture
of
terrestrial
and
arboreal
habits
traced
within
the
evolutionary
lineage
of
Mesopithecus
is
important
when
related
to
its
key
position
in
the
evolutionary
history
of
the
Colobinae
.
Mesopithecus
,
which
geologically
ranged
in
the
late
Miocene
and
early
Pliocene
(
8.7
–
3
Ma
)
,
is
the
oldest
Eurasian
colobine
(
Szalay
and
Delson
,
1979
)
.
It
postdates
the
African-Asian
colobine
split
that
is
genetically
estimated
at
10.8
Ma
(
Raaum
et
al.
,
2005
;
Sterner
et
al.
,
2006
;
Ting
,
2008
)
,
as
well
as
the
subsequent
migration
of
the
Asian
clade
from
Africa
to
Eurasia
(
10
Ma
:
Delson
,
1994
;
Stewart
and
Disotell
,
1998
)
.
The
basically
terrestrial/arboreal
quadrupedal
locomotion
of
Mesopithecus
may
be
strongly
related
to
the
ancestral
,
primarily
terrestrial
habits
of
the
earliest
cercopithecids
,
like
Victoriapithecus
(
Harrison
,
1989
;
Benefit
,
1999
)
.
These
morpho-behavioral
adaptations
can
be
considered
as
plesiomorphic
in
early
colobines
and
would
facilitate
the
dispersal
of
Mesopithecus
out
of
Africa
via
relatively
seasonal
woodland
savannas
towards
southeastern
Europe
.
The
relatively
open
habitats
that
these
immigrants
encountered
in
Europe
resulted
in
a
group
of
mainly
semi-terrestrial
forms
with
variable
commitment
to
terrestriality
(
Jablonski
,
2002
)
,
with
the
exception
of
later
forms
that
appeared
to
be
adapted
to
more
humid
habitats
(
Delson
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
Recent
discoveries
have
shown
that
some
of
the
earliest
colobines
,
such
as
Microcolobus
,
were
largely
arboreal
(
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
Microcolobus
exhibits
both
modern
(
i.e.
,
wide
talar
head
,
proximodistally
short
cuboid
and
ectocuneiform
)
and
primitive
(
non-diminished
pollex
)
colobine
postcranial
features
(
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
,
2010
)
,
like
Mesopithecus
(
Szalay
and
Delson
,
1979
)
.
These
adaptations
reflect
an
early
divergence
towards
a
more
arboreal
way
of
life
and
may
refer
to
,
conservatively
,
the
group
affiliated
to
later
African
forms
,
or
to
all
ancestral
colobines
.
If
Mesopithecus
is
considered
as
a
part
of
this
crown
group
,
then
the
variable
degree
of
terrestriality
would
have
evolved
secondarily
,
most
likely
as
an
adaptation
to
more
marginal
seasonal
habitats
rather
than
forests
.
Subsequently
,
these
adaptations
would
have
enabled
this
early
stock
to
migrate
north
to
Eurasia
taking
advantage
of
drier
open
corridors
.
This
may
partly
explain
the
occurrence
of
arboreal
adaptations
in
the
early
Turolian
M.
delsoni
,
as
retentions
of
the
earliest
colobine
morphotype
(
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
The
close
affinities
of
Mesopithecus
with
Asian
colobines
,
and
more
particularly
the
derived
odd-nosed
genera
of
southeast
Asia
(
Jablonksi
,
1998
,
2002
;
Pan
et
al.
,
2004
)
may
render
the
above
hypothesis
less
plausible
.
Mesopithecus
may
have
originated
from
a
stock
different
from
that
of
Microcolobus
,
having
retained
terrestrial
adaptations
that
facilitated
the
exploitation
of
more
open
habitats
,
leaving
the
forests
open
for
the
earlier
representatives
of
the
African
stock
.
The
morphological
differences
identified
between
the
African
and
Asian
groups
may
in
fact
reflect
this
ancestral
split
of
differential
habitat
use
(
Delson
,
1975
;
Szalay
and
Delson
,
1979
;
Strasser
and
Delson
,
1987
;
Strasser
,
1988
;
Jablonski
,
2002
;
Nakatsukasa
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
this
case
,
arboreal
adaptations
evolved
later
to
exploit
the
mixture
of
open
and
closed
habitats
exploited
by
the
different
forms
and
species
of
Mesopithecus
towards
and
across
Eurasia
.
These
assumptions
render
the
study
of
two
fossil
forms
attributed
to
Mesopithecus
from
northern
India
(
Harrison
and
Delson
,
2007
)
and
southern
China
(
Jablonski
et
al.
,
2011
)
fundamental
in
shedding
light
to
the
adaptations
that
led
to
the
eastwards
dispersal
of
Mesopithecus
and
its
affinities
to
odd-nosed
colobines
.
None
of
the
above
hypotheses
can
be
precluded
,
since
behavioral
changes
have
been
regularly
encountered
within
the
evolutionary
lineages
of
primates
and
more
particularly
cercopithecids
(
e.g.
,
Gebo
and
Sargis
,
1994
)
.
This
is
particularly
evident
when
tracing
locomotor
changes
within
the
odd-nosed
colobines
that
are
closely
related
to
Mesopithecus
(
Jablonski
,
2002
;
Pan
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
The
earliest
form
of
this
group
,
the
mainly
semi-terrestrial
northern
snub-nosed
monkeys
(
Rhinopithecus
spp
.
)
inhabits
patchy
environments
in
south
China
and
northern
Indochina
(
Davison
,
1982
;
Kirkpatrick
and
Long
,
1994
;
Oates
et
al.
,
1994
;
Ren
et
al.
,
2001
;
Pan
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
However
,
the
most
primitive
Rhinopithecus
brelichi
and
Rhinopithecus
avunculus
are
reportedly
arboreal
,
while
the
most
derived
Rhinopithecus
roxellanae
and
Rhinopithecus
bieti
are
semi-terrestrial
(
Zhang
and
Ryder
,
1998
;
Li
et
al.
,
2001
,
2004
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
arboreal
and
suspensory
habits
of
the
southern
genera
Pygathrix
,
Simias
,
and
Nasalis
imply
a
basically
and
generally
arboreal
bauplan
for
the
group
as
a
whole
.
These
arboreal
tendencies
may
have
been
inherited
from
an
earlier
Mesopithecus
-
like
ancestor
,
which
had
retained
similar
arboreal
adaptations
within
a
basically
terrestrially
adapted
postcranial
blueprint
.
The
detailed
study
of
the
locomotor
ecology
of
odd-nosed
colobines
,
and
the
discovery
of
new
material
related
to
Mesopithecus
from
Asia
are
therefore
essential
for
understanding
any
modifications
in
their
ecological
morphology
and
habitat
use
.
