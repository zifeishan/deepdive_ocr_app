concentrations
in
the
Gobi
Desert
of
Mongolia
Abstract
Dust
mass
concentrations
of
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
from
four
monitoring
stations
in
the
Gobi
Desert
region
of
Mongolia
were
analyzed
for
a
16-month
period
in
2009
–
2010
.
Annual
averaged
PM
10
concentration
ranged
from
9
μg
m
−
3
to
49
μg
m
−
3
at
these
stations
during
2009
.
Concentrations
were
high
in
winter
owing
to
air
pollution
and
in
spring
owing
to
dust
storms
;
the
monthly
mean
concentrations
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
at
the
three
stations
except
for
Sainshand
reached
yearly
maxima
in
December
and
January
,
ranging
from
60
(
38
)
μg
m
−
3
to
120
(

.
Both
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
were
enhanced
from
March
to
May
by
dust
storms
.
Dust
storms
raised
huge
amounts
of
fine
dust
particles
in
the
Gobi
of
Mongolia
.

Introduction
Dust
storms
in
the
extensive
Gobi
and
desert-steppe
zones
of
Mongolia
occur
frequently
and
sometimes
cause
serious
disasters
(
Shao
and
Dong
,
2006
)
.
Dust
and
sand
storms
disrupt
human
life
and
economic
activities
and
result
in
soil
erosion
in
Mongolia
(
Natsagdorj
et
al.
,
2003
)
.
Dust
storms
progress
from
source
regions
to
downstream
regions
.
Coarse
dust
particles
(
31
–
62
μm
)
can
travel
up
to
320
km
from
their
source
,
medium
dust
particles
(
16
–
31
μm
)
can
travel
up
to
1600
km
,
and
fine
dust
particles
(
<
16
μm
)
can
be
transported
globally
(
Goudie
and
Middleton
,
2006
)
.
A
sand
storm
that
began
in
the
northern
Taklamakan
Desert
on
22
April
1999
traveled
southward
to
the
city
of
Hotan
at
the
southern
edge
of
the
Taklamakan
Desert
.
Surface
soil
and
fallout
dust
particles
sampled
in
the
vicinity
of
Hotan
had
average
diameters
of
130
and
63
μm
,
respectively
,
and
particles
10
μm
and
smaller
were
readily
transported
as
aeolian
aerosols
(
Nishikawa
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
The
severe
dust
storm
in
eastern
Mongolia
of
26
–
27
May
2008
caused
the
deaths
of
52
people
(
including
14
children
)
and
about
242,000
livestock
,
as
well
as
damage
to
110
buildings
,
221
houses
,
62
electric
poles
,
and
668
telecommunication
poles
.
Total
costs
for
this
single
event
,
including
losses
,
disinfection
and
rehabilitation
,
were
around
640.2
million
Tugrig
(
USD
457,000
)
(
Tsogt
and
Munkjargal
,
2008
)
.
The
storm
went
on
to
affect
downstream
regions
of
northeast
Asia
.
The
observed
PM
10
concentration
in
Seoul
peaked
at
0600
UTC
on
30
May
2008
with
a
maximum
hourly
average
of
900
μg
m
−
3
,
and
maximum
PM
10
concentrations
in
Jeonju
,
Gwangju
,
and
Daegu
in
Korea
were
650
to
700
μg
m
−
3
during
that
time
period
(
Kim
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
In
recent
years
the
role
of
desert
dust
has
become
increasingly
important
not
only
in
global
climate
change
(
Park
et
al.
,
2005
,
Goudie
and
Middleton
,
2006
and
Park
and
Jeong
,
2008
)
but
also
in
human
health
(
e.g.
,
Meng
and
Zhang
,
2006
,
Wei
and
Meng
,
2006
,
Deng
et
al.
,
2007
,
Lee
et
al.
,
2007
and
Park
and
Jeong
,
2008
)
.
Recently
,
dust
storms
are
usually
studied
by
measuring
particulate
matter
in
the
atmosphere
.
Natural
particulate
matter
arises
from
dust
storms
,
volcanoes
,
forest
and
grassland
fires
,
pollen
and
spores
released
by
plants
,
and
salt
particles
from
breaking
waves
(
Lutgens
and
Tarbuck
,
1998
)
.
Anthropogenic
sources
related
to
urbanization
,
industrialization
,
and
exploitation
of
natural
resources
also
generate
aerosols
such
as
smoke
,
dust
,
haze
,
and
fog
and
rain
droplets
.
Particulate
matter
in
the
air
is
usually
divided
into
populations
with
aerodynamic
diameters
less
than
10
μm
(
PM
10
)
,
2.5
μm
(
PM
2.5
)
,
or
1.0
μm
(
PM
1.0
)
and
is
measured
by
instruments
near
the
ground
surface
and
by
lidar
in
the
troposphere
.
During
dust
storm
periods
,
PM
10
concentrations
increase
substantially
in
source
areas
as
well
as
downstream
regions
.
For
example
,
in
the
Taklamakan
Desert
,
a
source
area
,
the
highest
PM
10
concentrations
during
2004
–
2006
were
observed
during
spring
at
stations
Tazhong
(
876
μg
m
−
3
)
and
Hetian
(
703
μg
m
−
3
)
,
located
respectively
in
the
center
and
southern
margin
of
the
desert
(
Wang
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
In
Beijing
,
a
downstream
location
,
the
PM
10
mass
concentration
during
the
severe
dust
storm
days
of
6
and
25
April
2000
reached
898
and
720
μg
m
−
3
,
respectively
,
several
times
the
daily
average
concentration
of
190
μg
m
−
3
in
Beijing
and
the
National
Ambient
Air
Quality
Standard
of
150
μg
m
−
3
for
24-h
PM
10
concentration
in
China
(
Xie
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
Similar
incidents
have
been
documented
of
Mongolian
dust
reaching
Taiwan
in
2004
(
Liu
et
al.
,
2009
)
and
Korea
in
2002
(
Lee
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
A
collaboration
between
Korea
,
Japan
,
China
and
Mongolia
installed
and
maintained
a
new
monitoring
network
for
dust
storms
in
Mongolia
from
2007
to
2010
.
Quantitative
data
from
this
network
promise
to
be
an
important
source
of
data
on
dust
storms
for
model
development
and
validation
(
Shao
and
Dong
,
2006
,
Park
and
Jeong
,
2008
and
Park
and
Jeong
,
2008
)
,
assessing
dust
impact
on
human
health
,
and
other
purposes
.
Because
of
the
lack
of
quantitative
data
on
dust
concentrations
in
Mongolian
dust
source
regions
,
most
previous
studies
have
mainly
analyzed
synoptic
data
on
dust
storms
(
Natsagdorj
et
al.
,
2003
)
.
Recently
,
Shinoda
et
al.
(
2010a
)
studied
dust
emission
and
saltation
processes
and
vegetation
conditions
at
Bayan
Unjuul
,
in
the
steppe
zone
of
Mongolia
,
during
a
dust
storm
period
.
Park
et
al.
(
2010
)
analyzed
in
detail
temporal
variations
of
dust
concentrations
(
PM
10
)
during
2009
together
with
meteorological
data
from
Erdene
,
in
the
Gobi
Desert
of
Mongolia
.
This
study
was
the
first
to
examine
quantitative
data
on
dust
storms
using
dust
concentrations
(
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
)
observed
at
four
sites
in
the
Gobi
Desert
of
Mongolia
.
One
of
our
goals
was
to
find
characteristic
features
of
dust
storms
in
these
data
.
We
analyzed
annual
and
diurnal
variations
of
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
associated
with
dust
storms
during
2009
–
2010
,
and
made
a
case
study
of
the
dust
storm
of
26
–
27
May
2008
using
mass
concentrations
of
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
as
well
as
vertical
profiles
obtained
by
lidar
.

Data
and
method
For
the
Regional
Master
Plan
for
prevention
and
control
of
dust
and
sand
storms
in
Northeast
Asia
,
the
governments
of
Japan
,
Korea
,
and
China
provided
support
for
nine
dust
monitoring
stations
in
Mongolia
from
2007
to
2010
(
Fig.
1
and
Table
1
)
.
These
stations
were
established
at
existing
meteorological
stations
in
dust
storm
source
regions
.
Five
stations
were
in
the
Gobi
Desert
:
Zamyn-Uud
,
Sainshand
,
and
Erdene
in
Dornogobi
province
,
Dalanzadgad
in
Umnugobi
province
,
and
Altai
in
Gobi-Altai
province
(
Mongolia
Assessment
on
Climate
Change
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
Four
stations
were
in
the
steppe
region
:
Arvaikheer
in
Uverkhangai
province
,
Undurkhaan
in
Khentei
province
,
Bayan
Unjuul
in
Tuv
province
,
and
Ulaanbaatar
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Mie
scattering
lidar
units
were
installed
at
Zamyn-Uud
,
Sainshand
,
and
Ulaanbaatar
by
the
Japanese
International
Cooperation
Agency
(
JICA
)
and
the
Japan
National
Institute
for
Environmental
Studies
(
NIES
)
.
A
20-m
monitoring
tower
was
installed
at
Erdene
during
2007
–
2008
by
the
Korean
Meteorological
Administration
(
KMA
)
and
equipped
with
meteorological
instruments
at
2
,
4
,
6
,
8
,
16
,
and
20
m
above
ground
level
and
a
PM
10
measurement
instrument
at
3
m
above
ground
level
.
The
China
Meteorological
Administration
established
dust/sand
storm
monitoring
stations
at
Arvaikheer
,
Underkhaan
,
and
Altai
during
2008
–
2010
.
A
dust
monitoring
site
was
built
at
Bayan
Unjuul
in
2008
by
the
joint
Japan
–
Mongolia
–
USA
project
DUVEX
(
Dust-Vegetation
Interaction
Experiment
)
(
Shinoda
et
al.
,
2010a
)
.
This
site
was
established
for
the
drought
experiment
DREX
in
2004
(
Shinoda
et
al.
,
2010b
)
.
In
this
study
,
we
used
data
measured
at
Dalanzadgad
,
Sainshand
,
Zamyn-Uud
,
and
Erdene
in
the
Gobi
region
.
We
mainly
made
use
of
mass
concentrations
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
,
visibility
,
wind
speed
,
and
relative
humidity
measured
at
2
m
above
ground
level
at
these
four
sites
during
2009
–
2010
,
although
we
used
some
data
from
2008
for
a
case
study
.
The
hourly
measurements
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
were
analyzed
together
with
the
wind
speed
,
visibility
,
and
weather
conditions
from
the
daily
surface
and
500
hPa
upper-level
charts
produced
by
the
Institute
of
Meteorology
and
Hydrology
,
Mongolia
,
and
the
KMA
.
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
during
dust
storms
were
analyzed
along
with
synoptic
observations
and
passages
of
atmospheric
fronts
.
At
Dalanzadgad
,
Sainshand
and
Zamyn-Uud
,
concentrations
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
were
measured
by
a
nephelometer
,
an
instrument
that
measures
light
scattering
by
airborne
particulates
.
The
atmospheric
visibility
,
also
known
as
the
meteorological
optical
range
(
MOR
)
,
is
determined
by
the
amount
of
light
scattered
by
particles
of
all
types
in
the
air
that
passes
through
the
optical
sample
volume
.
At
Erdene
,
PM
10
concentration
data
were
obtained
with
a
β
gauge
(
the
beta
attenuation
method
)
.
Although
meteorological
data
were
available
for
levels
up
to
20
m
above
the
ground
,
we
used
only
the
wind
speed
and
relative
humidity
at
the
2
m
level
.
We
used
lidar
data
processed
by
NIES
.
A
Mie-scattering
lidar
network
established
by
NIES
operates
at
23
locations
in
Japan
,
Korea
,
China
,
Mongolia
,
and
Thailand
.
The
lidar
system
has
a
polarization
capability
and
uses
observation
wavelengths
of
532
nm
and
1064
nm
(
Sugimoto
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
Extinction
coefficients
,
aerosol
depolarization
ratios
,
and
attenuated
backscatter
coefficients
are
available
from
the
lidar
measurements
for
aerosol
vertical
profiles
from
ground
level
to
18
km
every
15
min
.
Detailed
information
on
measurement
methods
and
calibrations
have
been
reported
by
Nishizawa
et
al.
,
2010a
and

Results
3.1
.
Annual
and
diurnal
variations
of
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentration
data
measured
at
Dalanzadgad
,
Sainshand
,
Erdene
,
and
Zamyn-Uud
during
2009
–
2010
were
analyzed
.
If
the
ratios
between
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
are
stable
,
then
the
quality
of
the
data
can
ordinarily
be
assured
(
Nishikawa
,
2009
)
.
The
ratios
for
our
data
were
relatively
stable
seasonally
.
For
example
,
the
ratios
between
monthly
mean
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
at
Dalanzadgad
were
0.70
–
0.80
in
winter
and
0.52
–
0.67
in
spring
,
and
at
Zamyn-Uud
they
were
0.52
–
0.63
in
both
winter
and
spring
(
Table
2
)
.
Our
data
on
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
in
the
Gobi
of
Mongolia
showed
annual
and
diurnal
variations
.
Annual
mean
concentrations
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
during
2009
were
47
(
34
)
μg
m
−
3
at
Dalanzadgad
,
9
(
5
)
μg
m
−
3
at
Sainshand
,
and
49
μg
m
−
3
at
Erdene
.
Measurements
at
Zamyn-Uud
were
made
for
only
six
months
in
2009
because
of
instrumental
failure
,
and
no
annual
mean
could
be
calculated
.
The
monthly
mean
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
were
high
in
winter
and
spring
,
with
maxima
in
December
or
January
and
March
to
May
,
and
low
in
summer
(
Fig.

)
.
Monthly
mean
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
were
highest
at
Dalanzadgad
in
December
and
January
,

.
For
example
,
the
maximum
monthly

in
December
2009
was
120

,
it
was
about

.
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
were
highest
at
Dalanzadgad
and
lowest
at
Sainshand
.
The
diurnal
variation
of
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
at
Dalanzadgad
and
Zamyn-Uud
(
Fig.

had
two
maxima

and
two

,
at

and
0500
–
0600

.
In
addition
,
PM

concentrations
had
some
increasing
trend
in
the
afternoon
from

PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
during
dust
storms
In
this
section
,
we
analyzed
the
daily
and
hourly
means
and
maxima
of
wind
speeds
,
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
and
visibilities
at
four
sites
during
the
period
from
January
2009
to
April
2010
.
Our
criterion
for
dust
storm
events
was
an
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentration
exceeding
100
μg
m
−
3
and
a
daily
maximum
wind
speed
exceeding
6.0
m
s
−
1
.
The
criterion
for
the
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentration
is
close
to
the
values
of
102
to
105
μg

measured
during
dust
storms
in
the
Thar
Desert
of
India
and
the
Great
Plains
of
the
United
States
(
Goudie
and
Middleton
,
2006
)
.
Park
et
al.
(
2010
)
identified
dust
events
at
Erdene
as
the
peak
PM
10
concentration
exceeding
one
standard
deviation
of
the
annual
mean
concentration
(
150
μg
m
−
3
)
.
Based
on
the
two
criteria
,
from
2009
to
2010
,
we
identified
32
,
36
,
50
,
and
9
dust
events
at
Dalanzadgad
,
Zamyn-Uud
,
Erdene
and
Sainshand
,
respectively
.
In
the
winter
of
2009
–
2010
,
about
6
,
5
and
3
events
were
identified
at
Dalanzadgad
,
Zamyn-Uud
and
Erdene
,
correspondingly
.
Daily
mean
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
,
averaged
over
all
dust
storms
exceeding
6
h
at
each
site
,
were
198
(
115
)
μg

at
Dalanzadgad
,
64
(

at
Zamyn-Uud
,
and
234
μg

at
Erdene
.
The
maximum
daily
mean
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
during
dust
storm
periods
were
821
(
500

at
Dalanzadgad
,
308
(

)
μg

at
Zamyn-Uud
,
and
1328
μg

−
3
at
Erdene
.
Hourly
maximum
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
for
all
dust
events
at
our
four
stations
during
2009
–
2010
ranged
from
1333
(
517
)
μg
m
−
3
to
6626
(
2899
)
μg
m
−
3
.
The
highest
of
these
values
was
measured
at
Dalanzadgad
.
Averaged
duration
periods
for
dust
storms
were
6.4
h
at
Dalanzadgad
,
4.2
h
at
Sainshand
,
10.1
at
Erdene
and
5.6
h
at
Zamyn-Uud
.
Averaged
concentrations
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
for
these
duration
periods
of
the
dust
events
varied
from
204
(
101
)
μg

−
3
to
452
(
170
)
μg

.
The
relationships
among
the
PM
mass
concentrations
,
duration
of
dust
storms
,
and
visibility
represented
by
meteorological
optical
range
(
MOR
)
are
illustrated
for
Zamyn-Uud
and
Dalanzadgad
in
Fig.
5
.
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
and
visibilities
were
averaged
by
duration
period
of
dust
storms
.
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
increased
gradually
with
dust
storm
duration
.
During
dust
events
,
averaged
visibilities
were
around
4.2
km
at
both
Dalanzadgad
and
Sainshand
and
as
high
as
7.2
km
at
Zamyn-Uud
.
Hourly
visibility
decreased
with
increases
in
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
during
the
dust
event
period
.
Frequencies
of
visibilities
less
than
1
km
during
dust
storms
were
30.6
%
and
56.3
%
at
Zamyn-Uud
and
Dalanzadgad
,
respectively
.
The
lowest
visibility
values
during
dust
storms
for
the
study
period
were
37
m
at
Dalanzadgad
on
11
March
2010
and
225
m
at
Zamyn-Uud
on
19
January
2009
.
Hourly
mean
wind
speeds
varied
from
6
to
7.5
m
s
−
1
,
and
surface
maximum
winds
were
usually
11
to
18
m
s
−
1
during
dust
events
,
although
it
sometimes
reached
25
–
26
m
s
−
1
,
during
the
study
period
.
Relative
humidity
is
measured
at
Erdene
only
,
at
the
synchronic
time
with
the
dust
concentration
measurement
.
Fig.
6
shows
the
relationships
between
dust
concentrations
(
PM
10
)
and
relative
humidity
(
RH
)
with
the
dust
storm
duration
period
.
Minimum
relative
humidity
was
varying
from
16
%
to
36
%
together
with
the
increase
in
PM
10
concentrations
during
dust
events
at
Erdene
(
Fig.
6
)
.
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
increased
because
of
dust
storms
in
the
Gobi
,
when
the
air
was
very
dry
.
For
example
,
for
about
60
%
of
dust
events
at
the
Erdene
site
,
relative
humidity
was
less
than
20
%
with
the
increased
PM
10
concentration

Case
study
:
Event
of
26
–
27
May
2008
A
severe
dust
storm
accompanied
by
a
snow
storm
occurred
on
26
–
27
May
2008
in
the
eastern
provinces
of
Mongolia
.
A
cyclone
located
over
eastern
Mongolia
on
26
May
2008
deepened
to
a
central
pressure
of
988
hPa
(
Fig.
7
)
.
This
deep
cyclone
and
its
associated
cold
front
gave
rise
to
a
severe
dust
storm
in
eastern
Mongolia
on
26
–
27
May
.
Fig.

shows
the
Terra/MODIS

26
May
2008
with
a
coverage
limited
to
the
most
part
of
Mongolia
due
to
the
satellite
orbit
track
.
A
dust
zone
appeared
in
the
satellite
image
as
revealed
by
the
yellow
color
.
The
dust
zone
was
over
the
south-eastern
part
of
Mongolia
in
the
rear
side
of
the
cold
frontal
cloud
system
existing
over
the
eastern
region
of
the
country
and
the
south-eastern
bordering
area
between
Mongolia
and
China
.
The
central
areas
affected
by
the
dust
storm
were
Khentei
and
Sukhbaatar
provinces
,
where
observed
dust
concentration
data
were
not
available
.
We
analyzed
data
from
Zamyn-Uud
,
which
is
close
to
that
area
approximately
410
km
,
while
measurements
at
Sainshand
were
stopped
due
to
instrumental
failures
.
During
the
dust
event
on
26
May
2008
,
observed
PM
10
concentrations
at
Zamyn-Uud
were
as
high
as
190
–
1228
μg
m
−
3
between
0800
and
1800
UTC
,
and
the
visibility
ranged
from
300
to
700
m
between
0600
and
1500
UTC
(
Fig.

)
.
Although
the
weather
was
stormy
with
gusty
winds
of
11
to
24
m
s
−

at
Zamyn-Uud
for
the
whole
day
,
the
duration
of
dust
concentration
exceeding
100
μg
m
−
3
was
11
h
and
the
period
of
low
visibility
(
<
700
m
)
was
9
–
10
h.
Lidar
observations
of
tropospheric
aerosols
(
mineral
dust
and
air
pollution
aerosols
)
were
conducted
at
Zamyn-Uud
during
this
dust
storm
.
The
records
of
attenuated
backscatter
coefficients
at
532
nm
and
1024
nm
and
the
depolarization
ratio
at
532
nm
are
shown
in
Fig.

,
and
the
extinction
coefficient
is
shown
in
Fig.

.
The
colors
in
Fig.

show
the
density
of
dust
layers
;
the
red
,
green
and
blue
indicate
high
,
medium
and
low
density
,
respectively
.
Both
figures
show
that
on
26
–
27
May
,
the
dense
dust
layer
was
observed
up
to
0.5
km
above
the
land
surface
due
to
the
primary
cold
front
.
On
next
days
(
27
–
28
May
)
,
the
dust
elevated
owing
to
the
secondary
cold
front
,
reaching
about
3
km
height
(
Fig.
10
and
Fig.
11
)
.
The
extinction
coefficient
was
larger
than
2

during
the
dust
event
,
indicating
a
very
high
concentration
of
dust
during
26

Discussion
In
this
discussion
,
we
focused
on
the
following
two
points
.
The
first
is
the
definition
of
dust
storms
using
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentrations
.
Our
study
clearly
indicated
that
the
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentration
increased
significantly
in
the
source
regions
during
dust
storms
;
however
,
there
is
no
universally
accepted
definition
of
dust
storms
in
terms
of
hourly
dust
concentrations
.
Previous
researchers
have
classified
dust
storms
by
their
intensities
on
the
basis
of
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentrations
together
with
wind
speed
and
visibility
.
The
classification
system
proposed
by
Hoffmann
et
al.
(
2008
)
is
based
on
the
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentration
in
combination
with
visibility
and
wind
speed
as
follows
:
“
dusty
air
”
(
haze
)
means
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentrations
higher
than
50
μg
m
−
3
;
“
light
dust
storm
”
,
>
200
μg
m
−
3
;
“
dust
storm
”
,
>
500
μg
m
−
3
;
“
strong
dust
storm
”
,
>
2000
μg
m
−
3
;
and
“
serious
strong
dust
storm
”
,
>
5000
μg
m
−
3
(
Hoffmann
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
Wang
et
al.
(
2007
)
used
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentrations
of
<
200
μg
m
−
3
for
“
suspended
dust
,
”
200
–
5500
μg
m
−
3
for
“
blowing
dust
,
”
5500
–
15,000
μg
m
−
3
for
“
sand
and
dust
storm
”
,
and
>
15,000
μg
m
−
3
for
“
severe
sand
and
dust
storm
”
.
In
Taiwan
an
Asian
dust
storm
event
is
defined
each
day
that
hourly
mean
PM
10
concentrations
observed
at
the
Yangmingshan
station
exceed
the
air
quality
standard
(
125
μg
m
−
3
)
for
a
period
of
at
least
3
h
(
Yang
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
Dust
storms
are
defined
in
Korea
when
the
measured
PM
10
concentration
exceeds
190
μg
m
−
3
for
at
least
2
h
(
Chung
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
The
KMA
has
developed
an
Asian
Dust
Warning
System
with
alarm
,
advisory
,
and
warning
levels
depending
on
the
dust
concentration
.
Alarms
,
advisories
,
and
warnings
are
issued
when
the
hourly
mean
dust
concentrations
(
PM
10
)
are
expected
to
exceed
300
μg
m
−
3
,
400
μg
m
−
3
,
or
800
μg
m
−
3
,
respectively
,
for
over
2
h
(
Chung
et
al.
,
2005
)
.
The
second
point
for
the
discussion
is
sources
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
.
The
temporal
and
spatial
variations
reflect
both
natural
dust
storms
in
the
Gobi
Desert
and
anthropogenic
aerosols
in
population
centers
.
The
dust
storms
with
strong
winds
are
commonly
produced
by
cyclone
activities
,
which
are
enhanced
in
the
spring
(
Jugder
et
al.
,
2004
)
.
As
mentioned
in
Section
3.2
,
the
two
sources
were
distinguished
in
term
of
the
threshold
daily
maximum
wind
speed
of
6
m
s
−
1
;
high
concentrations
accompanied
by
the
strong
winds
exceeding
the
threshold
are
likely
derived
from
dust
storms
,
while
those
with
calm
weather
conditions
may
be
due
to
the
anthropogenic
aerosols
.
In
addition
,
climate
changes
that
already
have
been
observed
in
Mongolia
(
Mongolia
Assessment
on
Climate
Change
et
al.
,
2009
)
are
causing
substantial
effects
on
the
dust
storm
occurrences
in
the
Gobi
Desert
areas
.
As
,
in
2009
,
annual
mean
temperatures
at
Dalanzadgad
,
Sainshand
,
and
Zamyn-Uud
were
higher
than
normal
between
1971
and
2000
by
1.2
–
1.4
°
C
.
In
the
same
year
,
annual
precipitation
at
Dalanzadgad
was
less
than
normal
by
80
mm
,
while
it
was
near
normal
at
Sainshand
and
Zamyn-Uud
.
Such
data
at
Erdene
is
not
available
.
These
temperature
and
precipitation
anomalies
appeared
to
influence
increased
dust
storm
occurrences
;
for
example
,
in
2009
,
the
numbers
of
dusty
day
at
Dalanzadgad
were
2.2
times
higher
than
normal
,
while
it
was
slightly
higher
than
normal
at
Zamyn-Uud
and
close
to
normal
at
Sainshand
.
Other
sources
of
PM
10
(
PM
2.5
)
concentrations
were
anthropogenic
aerosols
.
Sources
of
anthropogenic
aerosols
in
population
centers
were
activities
such
as
fossil
fuel
burning
in
vehicles
,
power
plants
,
and
home
stoves
(
Mongolia
's
Initial
National
Communication
,
2001
,
Jugder
et
al.
,
2008
and
Mongolia
Assessment
on
Climate
Change
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
Air
quality
has
deteriorated
around
provincial
centers
as
increasing
demand
for
heat
and
electricity
has
caused
increased
emission
of
air
pollutants
from
industrial
and
domestic
sources
and
as
other
activities
have
eroded
soils
.
Weather
conditions
,
such
as
persistent
anticyclonic
circulation
and
surface
temperature
inversions
in
winter
,
can
also
cause
increases
in
air
pollutants
around
population
centers
(

and
Gomboluudev
,

and

Conclusions
The
present
study
showed
that
annual
mean
PM
10
(
PM

The
observed
data
at
the
sites
showed
dust
storms
representatively
in
the
Gobi
Desert
in
each
season
.
During
the
heavy
dust
storm
period
of
26
–
27
May
2010
,
measurements
at
Zamyn-Uud
showed
that
PM
10
concentrations
reached
1228
μg
m
−
3
,
visibility
ranged
from
300
to
700
m
,
gusty
winds
reached
24
m
s
−
1
,
and
the
dense
dust
layer
was
observed
up
to
0.5
km
above
the
land
surface
due
to
the
primary
cold
front
.
On
next
days
(
27
–
28
May
)
,
the
dust
elevated
owing
to
the
secondary
cold
front
,
reaching
about
3
km
height
.
The
records
of
attenuated
backscatter
coefficients
,
the
depolarization
ratio
and
the
extinction
coefficient
indicated
a
very
high
concentration
of
dust
during
26
–
28
May
2008
.
High
concentrations
of
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
were
related
to
both
natural
and
anthropogenic
sources
of
particulate
matter
.
The
two
sources
were
distinguished
in
term
of
the
threshold
daily
maximum
wind
speed
of
6
m
s
−
1
;
high
concentrations
accompanied
by
the
strong
winds
exceeding
the
threshold
wind
are
likely
derived
from
dust
storms
,
while
those
with
calm
weather
conditions
may
be
due
to
the
anthropogenic
aerosols
.
A
natural
source
was
dust
storms
developed
by
the
passage
of
cyclones
accompanied
by
cold
fronts
.
Anthropogenic
aerosols
were
found
to
be
high
around
Dalanzadgad
and
Zamyn-Uud
,
and
natural
dust
particles
were
high
around
Erdene
.
However
,
the
number
of
dusty
days
at
Dalanzadgad
in
2009
was
considerable
higher
than
normal
.
Anthropogenic
sources
may
include
burning
of
coal
in
population
centers
.
The
maximum
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
occurred
in
the
morning
and
evening
,
coinciding
with
coal
usage
in
private
houses
.
It
is
evident
that
human
activities
can
affect
local
air
quality
around
urban
localities
in
the
Gobi
of
Mongolia
.
Afternoon
peaks
in
PM
10
and
PM
2.5
concentrations
appear
to
be
due
to
dust
storms
.
