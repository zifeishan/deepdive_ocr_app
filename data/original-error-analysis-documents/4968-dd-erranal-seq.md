  The
  Parasitic
X Hymenoptera

  BY
  CHARLES
  T.
X BRUES
  .
  The
  present
  paper
  is
  based
  upon
  studies
  on
  the
  parasitic
X Hymenoptera
  contained
  in
  the
  very
  extensive
  collection
  of
  fossil
X insects
X made
  many
  years
  ago
  by
  Dr.
  Samuel
  H.
  Scudder
  at
  Florissant
  ,
  Colorado
  ,
  ,
X and
X now
  contained
  in
  the
  Museum
  of
  Comparative
X Zoology
  .
  In
  addition
  ,
  Prof

  .
  T.
  D.A.
  .
. Cockerell
  has
  sent
  me
  much
  material
  from
  the
  same
  locality
  obtained
  by
  expeditions
  under
  his
  charge
  during
  the
  summers
  of
  1907
  and
  1908
  ,
  most
  of
  this
  second
  series
  belonging
  to
  .
  the
  American
  Museum
  of
  Natural
  History
  .
  In
  all
  I
  "
  had
  the
  opportunity
  to
  examine
  over
  700
  well-preserved
  specimens
  of
  insects
  belonging
  to
  this
  group
  ,
  among
  which
  there
  are
  112
  clearly
X defined  (treated as ?)
  species
  which
  are
  described
  on
  the
  following
  pages
  .
  Adding
  ta
  these
  the
  13
  species
  previously
  described
  by
  Professor
  Cockerell
  and
  the
  present
X writer  (viviterj -> writer???)
  ,
  the
  total
X number (riumher / BLLmber???)
  so
  far
  found
  at
  Florissant
  is
  125
  .
  The
  very
  large
  number
  of
  species
  of
  parasitic
. Hymenoptera
  represented
  at
  Florissant
  shows
  it
  to
  be
  by
  far
  the
  richest
  locality
  in
  the
  world
  for
  these
  insects
  ,
  as
  it
  has
X already
  been
  found
  to
  be
  by
  Scudder
  for
  many
  other
  groups
  .
  This
  is
  shown
  in
  the
  following
  table
  which
  g
  a
X comparison
  between
  the
  several
  important
  places
  where
  fossil
  parasitic
X Hymenoptera
  have
  been
  found
  .
X Number
  of
  parasitic
X Hymenoptera
  found
  in
X various
X localities
  .
  With
  the
  exception
  of
X a
  single
  genus
  and
  species
  (
. Ephialtites
  )
  from
  the
  Upper
  Jurassic
  ,
  no
  parasitic
  Hymenoptera
  are
  known
  before
  the
  Tertiary
  .
  However
  ,
  the
  quite
  typical
  character
  of
  Ephialtites
  ,
  and
  the
  abundance
  in
  which
  the
  group
. appears
X in
  deposits
  of
  Lower
  Oligocene
  show
  that
  it
  must
. have
. been
  clearly
  differentiated
  and
  well
  developed
  at
  least
X before
  the
  beginning
  of
  the
X Tertiary
  .
  The
  discovery
  of
. Ephialtites
  in
  rocks
  so
  much
  older
  than
  those
  in
. which
  other
  of
. the
. higher
. Hymenoptera
  have
  been
  found
  has
  led
. Handlirsch
. to
. derive
  both
  the
  parasitic
  and
  aculeate
X Hymenoptera
