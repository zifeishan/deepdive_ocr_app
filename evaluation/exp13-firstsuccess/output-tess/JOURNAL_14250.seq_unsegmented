Abstract
In
order
to
observe
the
siliciﬁcation
process
of
polycystine
radiolarians
,
we
tried
to
culture
Streblacantha
cf.
circumtexta
with
the
addition
of
dissolved
silica
(
ﬁnal
concentration
10
uM
)
and
f/2
culture
medium
from
25th
,
Nov.
to
27th
,
Nov.
,
2009
.
During
our
session
of
observation
,
one
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
formed
siliceous
fragments
in
the
extracapsulum
part
of
the
protoplasm
,
which
were
subsequently
ejected
.
A
total
of
94
siliceous
fragments
were
thus
expelled
from
the
cell
by
using
the
low
—
contrast
thin
(
LCT
)
pseudopodia
.
Similar
siliceous
fragments
were
often
found
in
the
extracapsulum
of
many
pylonioid
spumellarians
,
suggesting
they
did
also
secret
isolated
siliceous
fragments
.
Pylonioids
may
silicify
continuously
,
and
the
normal
growth
rate
of
the
siliceous
skeleton
is
maintained
by
the
disposal
activity
of
excess
siliﬁcation
.

Introduction
siliciﬁcation
models
have
been
proposed
.
The
physical
model
of
Thompson
(
1942
)
is
the
best
known
amongst
them
;
it
interprets
Siliciﬁcation
processes
of
polycystine
radiolarians
(
marine
holoplanktonic
Rhizaria
)
(
Krabberod
et
al.
,
2011
)
have
been
discussed
and
hypothesized
for
more
than
a
century
(
e.g.
,
Haeckel
,
1862
)
.
Since
the
development
of
the

symmetry
in
radiolarians
was

the
tetrapod
spicular
form
of
the
polycystine
genus
Callimitra
as
being
formed
following
the
same
physical
process
as
the
formation
of
soap
bubbles
in
froth
.
This
model
has
been
widely
cited
in
scientiﬁc
books
;
however
,
the
observation
of
cytoplasmic
structure
using
transmission
electron
microscopy
(
TEM
)
revealed
that
the
siliceous
matter
of
polycystines
is
deposited
inside
a
silica
deposition
vacuole
(
SDV
)
that
was
formed
with
a
functional
membrane
,
silicalemma
(
Anderson
,
1994
)
.
The
formation
process
of
polycystine
skeletons
is
currently
understood
following
examination
of
the
skeletons
in
various
growth
stages

,
incomplete

shells
(
Anderson
et
al.
,

,

)
and
cross-sections
of
skeletons
(
Hurd
and
Theyer
,
1977
;
Nishimura
,
1990
)
.
Although
several
ﬂat-shaped
polycystines
,
like
Dictyocoryne
truncatum
,
appear
to
have
grown
during
laboratory
culture
(
e.g.
,
Matsuoka
and
Anderson
,
1992
)
,
no
direct
documentation
of
the
formation
of
skeletons
exists
as
yet
for
polycystines
with
the
exception
of
Anderson
(
1983
:
p.
127
)
who
gave
a
brief
account
of
light
microscopic
observations
of
the
spine
growth
in
a
living
radiolarian
.
In
order
to
directly
observe
the
skeletogenesis
of
living
polycystines
,
we
participated
in
November
2009
in
the
11th
Radiolarian
Observation
Tour
of
Living
Radiolarians
at
Sesoko
Island
,
hosted
by
Atsushi
Matsuoka
(
Niigata
University
)
.
In
this
tour
,
we
continuously
observed
the
behavior
of
several
radiolarian
cells
in
f/2
culture
medium
(
a
widely
used
seawater
medium
designed
for
growing
coastal
marine
organisms
)
with
the
addition
of
dissolved
silica
(
ﬁnal
concentration
10
p.
M
)
.
During
our
3-day
culturing
experiment
,
a
polycystine
radiolarian
species
,
Streblacantha
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jorgensen
)
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
,
appeared
to
undergo
skeletogenesis
where
siliceous
particles
abruptly
appeared
.
Many
siliceous
particles
were
formed
during
our
session
of
observation
,
which
were
subsequently
expelled
from
the
cell
through
the
tip
of
elongated
pseudopodia
.
This
behavior
,
documented
in
this
paper
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
,
was
so
slow
that
we
needed
a
10Xspeed
video
movie
(
real
60
min
were
converted
to
6min
)
to
fully
capture
it
.
We
examined
how
many
siliceous
fragments
were
ejected
,
whether
they
were
newly
formed
or
whether
they
simply
originated
from
the
breakage
of
siliceous
portions
of
the
skeleton
,
we
also
examined
whether
the
behavior
of
the
cell
was
related
to
the
formation
of
the
siliceous
fragments
.

Material
and
methods
The
living
radiolarians
examined
in
our
study
were
collected
from
the
surface

with

,
and
observed
in
the
Sesoko
Station
,
Tropical
Biosphere
Research
Center
,
University
of
the
Ryukyus
.
The
polycystine
cells
were
isolated
under
an
inverted
microscope
and
binocular
stereo
microscope
with
a
Pasteur
pipette
,
and
were
transferred
into
a
chamber
of
a
cell
culture
plate
with
16
mL
of
0.45
p.
m
,
ﬁltered
seawater
emended
with
f/2
culture
medium
and
silicate
ion
(
ﬁnal
concentration
:
10
p.
M
)
.
A
total
of
10
cells
of
different
species
were
incubated
together
in
the
same
culture
chamber
of
a
cell
culture
plate
to
compare
them
under
the
same
conditions
from
November
25th
to
Nov
27th
,
2009
.
Of
these
radiolarians
,
a
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jgbrgensen
)
was
recorded
with
a
Hi-Vision
digital
video
camera
(
SONY
Handycam
HDR
—
8R
,
1080i
)
attached
to
an
inverted
light
microscope
(
Olympus
CK2
)
.
The
total
of
nearly
continuous
video
recording
time
was
close
to
23
h
from
November
26th
to
Nov
27th
,
2009
(
Figs

)
.
Because
its
motility
was
too
slow
to
be
recognized
in
a
video
at
the
normal
speed
,
the
recorded
video
data
was
converted
to
a
10X-speed
video
movie
(
real
60
min
=
6
min
)
using
a
video-editing
software
,
Corel
Ulead
VideoStudio

for
Microsoft
Windows
.
The
PDMPO-experiment
introduced
in
this
paper
was
realized
a
year
before
,
November
25th
,
2008
,
during
the
10th
Radiolarian
Observation
Tour
(
hosted
by
Matsuoka
Atsushi
)
.
PDMPO
is
an
acronym
of
a
ﬂuorescent
compound
that
accumulates
in
acidic
cell
compartments
,

(
4pyridyl
)

(

(
2-dimethylaminoethylaminocarbamoyl
)
methoxy
)
-
phenyl

oxazole
(
PDMPO
)
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
PDMPO
is
accumulated
with
silica
under
acidic
conditions
,
and
the
newly
developed
silica
skeletons
display
a
green
ﬂuorescent
light
.
The
picked
cells
were
put
into
a
glass
tube
with
16
mL
of
seawater
ﬁltered
with
a
0.45
um
membrane
ﬁlter
.
The
PDMPO
(
ﬁnal
concentration
:
1.0
|
.
l.
l\\/I
)
was
dissolved
in
20
mL
of
percolated
seawater
in
advance
,
and
then
added
into
the
glass
tube
with
polycystine
cells
.
These
tubes
were
incubated
under
red
and
blue
LED
lights
for
12
h
and
in
dark
for
12
h
at
26
°
C.
After
the
incubation
,
the
samples
were
ﬁxed
with
a
5
%
formalin
solution
.
The
ﬁxed
materials
were
kept
in
5
OC
prior
to
observation
.
To
observe
the
stained
condition
with
PDMPO
,
the
material
was
dropped
on
a
glass
slide
and
covered
with
a
cover
glass
.
Four
lines
of
vaseline
were
spread
on
each
side
of
the
cover
glass
to
prevent
it
from
crushing
the
radiolarian
specimen
.
All
slides
were
observed
with
an
epiﬂuorescence
microscope
(
AX-80
,
Olympus
)
with
UV-excitation
(
WU
:
BP330
—
385
,
DM400
,
BA420
)
,
and
images
of
selected
cells
were
digitally
captured
with
a
CCD
camera
(
DXM-1200
,
Nikon
)
.
The
physiological
ecology
of
radiolarians
kept
in
a
laboratory
without
natural
light
is
expressed
occasionally
with
some
speciﬁc
movements
,
which
may
be
related
to
daily
cycles
(
e.g.
,
Anderson
,
1983
;
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
However
,
additional
evidence
is
needed
to
understand
the
daily
cycle
in
radiolarians
.
As
the
cell
observed
in
this
experiment
appears
to
be
active
during
in
daytime
and
inactive
at
night
,
this
paper
will
denote
physiological
events
at
real
time
,
instead
of
elapsed
time
from
the
beginning
of
our
observation
.

Results
Ten
cells
of
four
polycystine
species
were
incubated
for
3
days
with
silica-supplemented
seawater
;
only
one
of
them
(
a
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
)
formed
siliceous
fragments
and
then
ejected
them
.

An
overall
view
of
the
examined
cell
of
Streblacantha
cf.
circumtexta
.
It
can
be
noted
that
this
same
cell
of
this
species
looks
different
in
outline
of
the
skeleton
where
viewed
in
different
orientations
during
rotation
.
All
the
images
shown
Figs
.
3
through
6
are
the
exactly
same
cell
.
structure
hidden
behind
a
thick
,
opaque
cytoplasm
(
Figs
.
3.1-3
.9
)
.
As
shown
on
Fig.
3
,
the
cell
looks
very
different
,
depending
on
its
orientation
.
In
some
views
,
the
overall
shape
of
the
skeleton
appears
to
be
quadrate
(
Figs
.
3.1
,
3.2
)
,
ellipsoidal
(
Figs
.
3.4
,
3.5
)
,
oblong
(
Fig.
3.7
)
,
or
even
triangular
(
Fig.
3.8
)
.
A
girdle-like
pore
frame
was
also
recognized
(
e.g.
,
Fig.
3.9
)
.
Such
irregular
appearances
are
commonly
encountered
in
the
taxa
belonging
to
the
Superfamily
Pylonioidea
(
=
Pyloniacea
sensu
De
Wever
et
al.
,
2001
,
see
ICZN2000
)
.
However
,
no
apparent
gates
and
no
cupolas
related
to
pylonioid
girdles
are
present
in
it
,
suggesting
that
it
belongs
to
Tetrapyle
,
Tholonium
,
or
other
closely
related
genera
.
The
skeleton
of
the
cell
is
also
characterized
by
the
presence
of
larger
pores
.
Nearly
identical
morphotypes
to
our
cell
were
in
general
identiﬁed
as
Streblacantha
circumtexta
(
Jgzsrgensen
)
in
the
west
Paciﬁc
(
e.g.
,
Chen
and
Tan
,
1996
)
.
The
type
specimens
illustrated
in
Jorgensen
(
1905
)
are
somewhat
different
from
our
cell
in
the
absence
of
long
stout
radial
spines
,
so
that
we
tentatively
identiﬁed
this
cell
as
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Jszirgensen
)
.
The
cytoplasm
of
the
cell
consists
of
a
brownish
red
intracapsulum
and
whitish
translucent
extracapsulum
,
just
inside
the
siliceous
skeleton
(
Figs
.
4.1-4
.9
)
.
The
extracapsulum
inside
the
siliceous
test
appears
granular
,
with
granules
moving
slowly
inside
the
extracapsulum
throughout
the
session
of
observation
.
The
intracapsulum
is
spherical
in
shape
,
but
the
inner
brownish
red
endoplasm
changed
in
shape
between
spherical
and
elliptical
.
The
translucent
extracapsulum
fully
enclosed
the
skeleton
in
the
early
hours
of
the
day
(
Figs
.
3.1
,
3.2
,
4.1-4
.5
)
but
shrunk
progressively
afterwards
(
Figs
.
3.1-3
.9
,
4.9
)
.
The
pseudopodia
of
the
cell
belong
to
three
different
types
,
described
here
for
the
ﬁrst
time
:
high-contrast
,
very
thick
pseudopodia
(
HCT
pseudopodia
,
herein
)
,
low-contrast
thin
pseudopodia
(
LCT
pseudopodia
,
herein
)
and
a
single
thick
axoﬂagellum
(
Figs
.
4.1-4
.5
)

All
the
images
shown
on
Figs
.
3
through
6
are
the
exactly
same
cell
.
HCT
pseudopodia
are
easily
visible
in
a
wide
range
of
contrasts
using
an
optical
microscope
.
During
the
observation
period
,
the
HCT
pseudopodia
extended
40-80
pm
out
of
the
surface
of
the
intracapsulum
(
Figs
.
1
,
2
)
;
they
had
a
very
strong
adhesive
attachment
capacity
except
of
their
mobile
stage
of
these
pseudopodia
.
Intra-cytoplasmic
granules
moved
continuously
by
slow
cyclosis
up
and
down
the
length
within
each
pseudopodium
.
LCT
pseudopodia
are
barely
visible
under
the
high-contrast
Viewing
conditions
.
The
degree
of
contrast
of
even
the
same
pseudopodium
is
gradually
changeable
between
LCT
and
HCT
pseudopodia
in
a
variable
case
like
the
rhythmic
extension
and
contraction
movement
of
pseudopodia
(
e.g.
,
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
;
Suzuki
,
2005
;
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
The
LCT
pseudopodia
are
in
general
slightly
longer
(
70
—
l40
pm
in
length
)
than
HCT
pseudopodia
(
40-80
um
)
(
Figs
.
1
,
2
)
.
The
length
of
pseudopodia
is
measured
from
the
distance
between
the
observational
distal
end
of
pseudopodia
and
the
surface
of
the
intracapsulum
,
and
is
always
shown
as
total
length
in
both
text
and
ﬁgures
.
Differing
from
the
HCT
pseudopodia
,
the
LCT
pseudopodia
have
no
apparent
adhesive
capacity
.
The
observed
specimen
has
a
single
axoﬂagellum
.
The
axoﬂagellum
of
this
specimen
appears
thicker
than
the
LCT
pseudopodia
and
thinner
than
HCT
pseudopodia
;
it
is
easily
differentiated
from
other
pseudopodia
when
the
LCT
pseudopodia
are
contracted
.
The
axoﬂagellum
is
generally
immobile
(
150
pm
in
length
)
,
but
it
occasionally
shrinks
down
to
60
pm
in
length
.

When

,
it
extends
at
the
same
time
as

Cytological
behavior
afpseudopadia
The
cytological
behavior
of
pseudopodia
was
continuously
recorded
from
the
early
morning
on
26th
Nov.
,
2009
to
the
early
morning
of
the
27th
Nov.
,
2009
(
Figs
.
1
,
2
)
.
Pseudopodia
occasionally
elongated
and
contracted
8:30
AM
and
16:00
PM
on
26th
Nov.
,
2009
.
Both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
occasionally
extended
90-170
um
and
170-350
pm
in
length
,
respectively
at
variable
intervals
from
20
to
60
min
.
Following
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
(
2001
)
,
the
shortened
condition
,
the
inception
of
the
extended
condition
,
the
ultimate
longest
condition
,
and
the
inception
of
pseudopodia
]
contraction
are
named
as
S
-
,
E
-
,
L
-
and
C-modes
,
respectively
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Most
of
the
time
the
cell
was
in
S-mode
(
Fig.
4.1
)
for
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Columns
C
and
D
on
Fig.
1
)
while
the
axoﬂagellum
was
in
L-mode
(
Fig.
4.1
)
(
Column
E
on
Fig.
1
)
.
Lmode
duration
in
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Fig.
4.4
)
was
very
short
(
<
1
min
)
,
and
simultaneously
the
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
were
in
the
E
-
,
L
-
and
C-modes
(
Figs
.
4.2-4
.5
)
.
Although
the
adhesive
capacity
and
other
characteristics
are
different
between
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
,
the
continuous
transformations
from
E-mode
to
C-mode
through
L-mode
occurred
simultaneously
in
both
the
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Figs
.
4.4
,
4.5
;
9:30

15:05
PM
,
15:50
PM
on

)
,
with
few
exceptions
.
The
axoﬂagellum
occasionally
changed
from
L-mode
to
S
-
or
C-mode
before
the
start
of
E-mode
in
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
(
a
typical
case
was
recorded
at
9:05
-9:30
AM
and
10:20
-10:30
AM
on
Fig.
1
)
,
and
the
axoﬂagellum
simultaneously
extended
as
E-mode
at
the
same
time
that
E-mode
of
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
occurred
(
ca.
9:30
AM
,
10:30
AM
,
11:55
AM
,
12:35
PM
,
13:35
PM
,
14:05
PM
on
Fig.

)
.
A
series
of
movements
from
C-mode
to
E-mode
via
very
short
or
no
S-mode
intervals
repeated
after
around
13:25
for
the
axoﬂagellum
.

and

and

was

Siliceous
fragments
As
shown
on
Figs
.
4.6-4
.9
,
solid
siliceous
fragments
of
10
to
30
pm
in
size
were
found
adjacent
to
the
cell
during
the
observation
days
.
A
total
of
94
fragments
were
recorded
on
the
digital
video
.
The
fragments
are
trifurcate
,
ramiform
or
plate-like
;
some
others
appear
to
be
part
of
a
pore-frame
.
More
fragments
might
have
existed
since
we
were
able
to
observe
the
cell
from
one
side
only
.
All
identiﬁable
siliceous
fragments
were
digitally
captured
and
numbered
in
sequence
(
Figs
.
1
,
2
)
.
It
is
interesting
that
a
new
fragment
was
abruptly
observable
.
It
was
generally
difﬁcult
for
us
to
eyewitness
the
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
.
The
upper
side
of
the
cell
easily
rotated
sideways
and
new
siliceous
fragments
were
generally
hidden
behind
the
cell
.
However
,
the
formation
process
of
a
fragment
(
fragment
ID
8
)
was
successfully
recorded
in
the
digital
video
(
Figs
.
5.1-5
.21
)
.
It
is
best
understood
by
winding
back
the
video
record
.
The
fragment
moved
out
of
a
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
around
09:26
AM
on
26th
,
Nov.
(
Figs
.
5.20
,
5.21
)
.
The
fragment
was
ﬁrst
recognizable
inside
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
around
09:25
AM
(
Figs
.
5.15-5
.19
)
.
Prior
to
this
time
,
no
distinguishable
outline
was
discernible
regardless
of
the
orientation
of
the
cell
(
Figs
.
5.9-5
.14
)
,
but
shadow
that
may
possibly
be
the
fragment
is
distinguishable
in
the
earlier
record
(
Figs
.
5.6-5
.8
)
.
Similar
phenomena
were
recorded
for
other
fragments
,
but
the
timing
of
the
start
of
the
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
was
not
precisely
determined
due
to
rotation
of
the
cell
during
the
observation
.
There
are
four
possible
sources
of
fragments
:
debris
in
the
cell
;
breakage
of
pieces
from
pre-existing
cell
skeleton
;
newly
formed
fragments
during
our
observation
session
;
captured
polycystines
as
prey
.
Since
the
cell
slowly
rotated
many
times
during
the
recording
period
,
we
could
conﬁrm
many
times
that
there
was
an
absence
of
fragments
.
This
rotation
also
allowed
us
to
compare
the
same
face
of
the
test
at
different
times
.
Several
fragments
look
like
a
portion
of
a
pore-frame
approximately
10-20
pm
in
size
(
Fig.
4.7
)
,
but
as
the
pores
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
are
much
larger
(
ca.
30-40
pm
)
breakage
is
not
a
likely
source
of
fragments
.
The
addition
of
new
pore
frame
would
have
been
easily
recognized
if
it
happened
,
but
we
did
not
observe
it
.
It
is
unlikely
to
be
sourced
from
captured
polycystines
as
prey
because
we
have
never
encountered
captured
polycystines
by
other
polycystines
in
our
observed
thousands
living
specimens
during
our
ﬁfteen
years
experience
.

Disposal
activity
of
siliceous
fragments
The
most
important
discovery
in
this
observation
is
the
disposal
activity
of
siliceous
fragments
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
.
The
sequential
record
of
each
fragment
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
disposal
movement
is
shown
in
the
B
column
of
Figs
.
1
and
2
.
In
most
cases
the
disposal
movement
occurred
in
clusters
of
several
siliceous
fragments
after
the
spontaneous
extension
of
both
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
and
shrinkage
of
the
axoﬂagellum
(
9:30
-9:50
,
12:00
-12
:
10
,
13:40
-13:50
,
14:10
-14:05
,
14:35
-14:40
,
15:10
-15:10
on
Fig.
1
)
.
The
siliceous
fragments
were
always
disposed
by
movement
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
A
siliceous
fragment
moved
outside
by
elongation
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
,
or
moved
occasionally
forward
or
backward
from
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
.
Once
a
fragment
apparently
moved
outside
,
this
fragment
was
never
withdrawn
back
to
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
.
The
fragment
in
this
condition
was
generally
attached
to
the
distal
end
of
tens
of
LCT
pseudopodia
(
Figs
.
6.1-6
.3
)
.
When
the
LCT
pseudopodia
extended
to
a
total
length
of
ca.
100
um
,
fragments
were
gently
detached
and
the
LCT
pseudopodia
slid
away
of
the
released
fragment
.

Discussion
One
may
wonder
whether
observation
made
in
the
laboratory
correspond
to
normal
cell
behaviour
.
This
question
may
not
have
been
addressed
adequately
in
this
study
.
However
,
in
spite
of
this
uncertainty
,
we
believe
it
is
worthwhile
reporting
and
discussing
it
because
this
is
the
ﬁrst
direct
observation
of
a
polycystine
forming
siliciﬁed
fragments
.

Slow
siliciﬁcation
of
polycystines
This
culture
experiment
was
initially
planned
to
encourage
siliciﬁcation
by
adding
dissolved
silica
;
we
had
initially
planned
to
verify
newly
siliciﬁed
parts
with
a
ﬂuorescent
compound
,
PDMPO
(
for
a
detailed
description
of
the
method
see
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
,
2010
)
.
In
spite
of
numerous
efforts
made
by
radiolarian
workers
to
observe
living
polycystines
,
nobody
has
directly
observed
skeleton
formation
with
the
exception
of
Anderson
(
1983
:
p.
127
)
.
Three
possibilities
may
explain
this
:
o
polycystine
cells
die
within
a
few
days
during
laboratory
culture
(
e.g.
,
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
)
;
o
they
can
not
form
a
skeleton
because
of
shortage
of
dissolved
silica
in
natural
sea
water
;
o
skeletogenesis
is
a
very
slow
process
.
The
cytological
behavior
of
polycystines
is
commonly
slow
or
nearly
static
except
for
very
occasional
abrupt
movements
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
;
Suzuki
,
2005
;
Suzuki
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
Thus
,
long-term
continuous
observations
of
a
single
cell
with
a
video
recorder
are
essential
to
study
their
physiological
ecology
.
During
200-times
fast
screening
observation
(
60
min
=
18
s
;
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
of
our
recording
of
the
radiolarian
behavior
we
realized
that
the
siliceous
fragments
formation
is
an
extremely
slow
process
(
the
ﬁlm
attached
is
18
s
and
it
corresponds
to
an
1
h
in
reality
)
.
The
formation
model
of
siliceous
skeletons
consists
of
primary
growth
(
PG
)
,
secondary
growth
(
SG
)
and
skeletal
thickening
growth
(
STG
)
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2010
)
.
PG
forms
the
principal
framework
of
skeletons
and
SG
is
the
formation
of
a
new
siliceous
part
on
the
already
existing
skeleton
(
Anderson
and
Bennett
,
1985
)
.
STG
thickens
the
already
existing
skeletons
but
never
forms
a
new
skeleton
part
like
PG
and
SG
(
Ogane
et
al.
,
2009
)
.
We
conclude
that
the
siliciﬁcation
by
S.
cf.
circamtexta
reported
in
this
paper
is
a
kind
of
SG
.

.
Patchwork
siliciﬁcation
and
disposal
activity
Our
conclusion
about
patchwork
siliciﬁcation
is
inferred
based
on
our
observation
of
formation
of
siliceous
fragments
.
It
is
unlikely
that
these
siliceous
fragments
originated
from
pre-existing
broken
particles
around/on
the
cell
,
because
the
cell
expelled
at
least
94
fragments
.

already
present
,
our
23-hours
continuous
video
record
would
have
shown
the
cell
as
being
surrounded
by
them
.
It
is
also
unlikely
that
the
cell
had
broken
its
own
skeleton
,
because
we
have
not
detected
any
evidence
of
breakage
.
Why
should
the
cell
dispose
of
the
siliceous
fragments
?
Two
points
need
to
be
evaluated
:
the
added
silica
concentration
in
the
culture
medium
,
and
other
observational
data
about
the
formation
of
new
skeleton
parts
via
PG
or
SG
.
The
cell
we
studied
was
incubated
in
silica-supplemented
ﬁltered
sea
water
for
about
3
days
.
We
added
10
p.M
silica
,
which
is
an
appropriate
concentration
if
by
reference
to
concentrations
of
10-35
|
.
LlVl
at
thermocline
water
depths
in
meridional
sections
through
the
Paciﬁc
Ocean
(
e.g.
,
Plate
1.2.5
(
c
)
in
Siedler
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
This
silica
concentration
is
not
considered
to
be
sufﬁcient
to
enhance
siliciﬁcation
by
the
cell
,
although
the
additional
dissolved
silica
may
motivate
it
to
form
new
siliceous
fragments
.
Sugiyama
and
Anderson
(
1997
)
reported
no
signiﬁcant
differences
between
silica-supplemented
and
control
groups
in
an
experimental
study
:
rather
,
the
cells
died
in
extraordinarily
silica-rich
seawater
(
150
uM
,
3-10
times
larger
than
the
normal
sea
water
)
.
Additional
supportive
evidence
is
shown
on
Figs
.
7.4-7

.
A
cell
of
Lithelius
sp
.
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
collected
from
the
East
China
Sea
where
we
routinely
collect
living
radiolarians
,
including
S.
of
.
circumtexta
,
was
observed
to
be
associated
with
siliceous
fragments
(
Fig.
7.4
)
.
When
this
cell
was
dyed
with
PDMPO
to
tag
the
siliﬁcation
sites
and
observed
under
the
epiﬂuorescent
microscope
(
Fig.
7.5
)
,
the
pre-existing
siliceous
fragment
and
its
own
skeleton
did
not
emit
with
PDMPO
,
implying
no
siliﬁcation
at
these
sites
(
black
arrows
on
Fig.
7.4
)
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
cytoplasmic
site
with
barely
observable
fragments
of
pore
frame
emitted
bright
green
ﬂuorescence
(
white
arrows
on
Figs
.
7.4
,
7.5
)
.
It
is
quite
difﬁcult
to
illustrate
these
barely
observable
fragments
of
the
pore
frame
due
to
their
very
faint
appearance
,
but
the
position
of
these
ﬂuorescing
parts
can
be
conﬁrmed
when
these
two
ﬁgures
are
overlapped
as
shown
on
Fig.
7.6
.
If
siliceous
fragments
can
be
formed
in
the
normal
sea
water
conditions
,
other
cells
must
have
many
siliceous
fragments
in
their
extracapsulum
.
Referring
to
our
archive
photos
of
living
radiolarians
,
we
found
that
cells
belonging
to
the
Superfamily
Pylonioidea
are
commonly
associated
with
siliceous
fragments
in
their
extracapsulum
(
Figs
.
7.1
,
7.2
)
.
Similar
siliceous
fragments
are
also
found
in
a
ﬂat-shaped
polycystine
(
Fig.
7.3
)
.
There
is
no
evidence
about
the
origin
of
the
siliceous
fragments
in
these
cells
,
but
we
have
commonly
observed
in
laboratory
that
the
pylonioids
with
HCT
pseudopodia
hold
siliceous
fragments
.
Furthermore
,
it
is
noted
that
almost
all
the
siliceous
fragments
are
always
located
inside
the
HCT
pseudopodial

.
This
observation
suggests
that
pylonioids
possessing
HCT
pseudopodia
can
form
siliceous
fragments
as
a
normal
process
of
siliciﬁcation
.
We
speculate
that
this
energy-wasting
behaviour
is
related
to
a
difference
of
siliciﬁcation
patterns
among
polycystines
.
Ogane
et
al.
(
2010
)
pointed
out
that
the
siliciﬁcation
process
of
some
polycystines
is
an
intermittent
process
.
By
contrast
,
our
cell
,
S.
cf.
circumtexta
,
showed
nonstop
siliciﬁcation
,
while
the
other
three
non-pylonioid
species
incubated
with
S.
of

circumtexta
(
Didymocyrtis

.
These
specimens
survived
for
3
days
with
S.
cf.
circumtexta
in
the
same
chamber
of
the
cell
culture
plate
,
but
no
growth
of
any
kind
was
observed
.
The
polycystines
with
non-stop
siliciﬁcation
like
Pylonioidea
do
patchwork
siliciﬁcation
and
disposal
activity
so
as
not
to
become
overgrown
,
differing
from
the
species
with
intermittent
growth
.
The
normal
condition
in
seawater
is
very
low
concentrations
of
dissolved
silica
(
Siedler
et
al.
,
2001
)
.
Siliciﬁcation
requires
a
source
of
energy
to
concentrate
and
solidify
this
highly
dilute
chemical
substance
from
a
dissolved
state
(
e.g.
,
Schroeder
,
1999
)
.
This
raises
the
question
on
the
adaptive
value
of
apparently
regulating
“
excessive
silica
deposition
”
by
secreting
large
fragments
and
expelling
them
.
It
may
be
difﬁcult
to
explain
that
this
phenomenon
is
a
control
mechanism
for
oversiliciﬁcation
,
given
the
very
dilute
quantities
of
silica
in
seawater
,
because
organisms
would
be
better
off
simply
to
stop
accumulating
more
silica
if
it
was
in
excess
.
These
processes
are
usually
tightly
controlled
biologically
,
and
normally
remain
active
only
enough
to
complete
the
biomineralized
shell
or
skeleton
.
This
phenomenon
,
as
observed
in
S.
cf.
circumtexta
and
other
pylonioids
,
would
be
a
remarkably
non-adaptive
way
for
a
living
organism
to
control
biomineralization
.
It
may
be
a
genetic
abnormality
that
has
mutated
to
turn
on
a
siliciﬁcation
process
in
the
extracapsulum
that
has
become
uncontrolled
.
There
are
some
similar
examples
of
genetic
errors
in
humans
,
such
as
the
uncontrolled
deposition
of
boney
deposits
in
the
skin
and
soft
tissues
of
the
body
(
osteoma
cutis
)
.
This
is
undoubtedly
a
genetic
anomaly
leading
to
what
we
would
call
in
humans
an
in-born
error
of
metabolism
.
The
evolutionary
origin
of
non-stop
siliﬁcation
in
the
pylonioids
with
HCT
pseudopodia
ought
to
shed
light
on
the
causes
of
diversiﬁcation
of
pylonioids
since
the
Paleocene
(
De
Wever
et
al.
,
2001
)
.

Function
of
cytoplasm
Various
physiological
functions
of
the
cytoplasm
have
been
studied
in
Collodaria
,
Spumellaria
and
Nassellaria
(
Anderson
,
1983
;
Matsuoka
,
2007
;
Sugiyama
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
We
have
recognized
a
new
siliciﬁcation
function
in
the
extracapsulum
based
on
our
supplemented
silica
experiment
with
S.
of
.
circumtexta
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
;
Figs
.
5.1
—
5.21
)
,
PDMPO-experiment
with
Lithelius
sp
.
(
Figs
.
7.4-7
.6
)
,
and
archive
photos
of
Pylonioidea
(
Figs
.
7.1
,
7.2
)
.
The
cytoplasmic
structure
with
a
siliciﬁcation
function
is
called
the
silicalemma
(
Anderson
,
1994
)
.
The
cell
examined
in
our
experiment
has
three
types
of
pseudopodia
,
namely
HCT
pseudopodia
,
LCT
pseudopodia
and
an
axoﬂagellum
.
HCT
pseudopodia
have
always
a
strong
adhesive
function
and
they
frequently
adhere
to
the
bottom
of
the
culture
chamber
.
This
adhesive
function
of
HCT
pseudopodia
helped
us
to
observe
the
specimen
continuously
for
23-hours
because
the
cell
did
not
move
in
the
culture
chamber
most
of
time
.
This
adhesive
function
of
HCT
pseudopodia
is
only
effected
for
a
limited
time
,
because
the
cell
occasionally
separated
from
the
bottom
and
ﬂoated
in
the
sea
water
of
the
culture
chamber
.
LCT
pseudopodia
were
used
to
expel
siliceous
fragments
.
When
LCT
pseudopodia
started
to
throw
a
siliceous
fragment
away
,
a
single
LCT
pseudopodium
or
a
few
LCT
pseudopodia
elongated
distally
with
the
siliceous
fragment
attached
on
the
tip
of
these
LCT
pseudopodia
.
The
siliceous
fragment
abruptly
detached
and
sank
down
without
any
rotation
of
the
siliceous
fragment
.
The
siliceous
fragment
simply
detached
from
the
adhesive
tip
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
or
was
discarded
with
a
small
portion
of
the
cytoplasm
of
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
Only
the
tip
of
LCT
pseudopodia
is
adhesive
.
We
do
not
recognize
adhesive
function
in
all
the
other
parts
of
LCT
pseudopodia
except
for
its
tip
.
This
means
that
the
polycystine
can
control
the
adhesive
condition
in
different
portions
along
the
LCT
pseudopodia
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
function
of
the
axoﬂagellum
is
still
unknown
.
Several
previous
papers
contain
comments
on
the
function
of
pseudopodia
to
support
a
planktonic
lifestyle
,
the
maintenance
of
buoyancy
,
the
sudden
contraction
against
attack
,
and
enhancement
of
protoplasmic
streaming
inside
the
endoplasm
in
solitary
spherical
polycystines
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
;
Suzuki
,
2005
;
Matsuoka
,
2007
)
.
The
functions
of
capturing
and
securing
a
prey
are
also
known
to
be
mediated
by
pseudopodia
in
both
Nassellaria
(
Sugiyama
et
al.
,
2008
)
and
solitary
spherical
polycystines
(
Suzuki
and
Sugiyama
,
2001
)
.
Pseudopodial
behavior
during
predation
,
sudden
contraction
against
attack
,
enhancement
of
protoplasmic
streaming
and
other
functions
could
be
explained
by
a
mechanical
response
to
simple
tactile
stimulation
.
However
,
the
pseudopodia
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
did
not
react
to
our
attempts
at
artiﬁcial
mechanical
stimulation
such
as
tapping
the
culture
plate
.
Although
the
exact
mode
of
radiolarian
pseudopodial
sensation
and
response
is
unknown
,
it
is
clear
that
the
cell
controls
complex
pseudopodial
activity
such
as
the
intricate
behavior
documented
here
in
our
research
.

.
Conclusions
A
single
cell
of
S.
cf.
circumtexta
(
Pylonioidea
,
Spumellaria
)
formed
at
least
94
siliceous
fragments
inside
the
extracapsulum
as
a
kind
of
SG
mode
.
After
residing
inside
the
bundle
of
HCT
pseudopodia
,
they
moved
outside
of
the
HCT
pseudopodia
by
the
elongation
of
a
few
LCT
pseudopodia
and
then
were
ejected
to
fall
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
culture
chamber
.
These
movements
were
documented
via
a
movie
(
Appendix
A
:
Movie
1
)
.
Pseudopodia
are
very
important
organelles
to
sustain
survival
.
They
are
divided
here
,
for
the
ﬁrst
time
,
into
two
types
,
HCT
and
LCT
pseudopodia
.
HCT
pseudopodia
are
named
due
to
their
high-contrast
thick
form
,
and
are
generally
shorter
than

Suzuki

Revue
de

56
(
2013
)
63-74
(
low-contrast
thin
)
LCT
pseudopodia
.
HCT
pseudopodia
have
an
adhesive
function
while
LCT
pseudopodia
can
move
actively
.
These
pseudopodia
do
not
react
to
simple
mechanical
stimulation
,
but
to
more
complex
,
speciﬁc
stimulation
.
