Solemys
(
Chelonii
,
Solemydidae
)
remains
from
the
Maastrichtian
of
Pyrenees
:
evidence
for
a
semi-aquatic
lifestyle
Abstract
We
report
on
a
turtle
from
the
Mina
Esquirol
site
(
Vallcebre
basin
)
,
a
new
locality
of
early
Maastrichtian
age
in
the
south-eastern
Pyrenees
.
Fossils
were
located
in
the
basal
Tremp
Formation
,
which
was
deposited
in
a
littoral
marsh
.
The
material
consists
of
a
cast
of
a
carapace
including
peripheral
fragments
and
partial
neural
plates
.
The
carapace
exhibits
a
vermiculate
ornamentation
that
is
characteristic
of
genus
Solemys
and
a
histological
bone
structure
similar
to
that
of
terrestrial
taxa
.
However
,
taphonomic
data
indicates
little
transport
and
a
short
biostratinomic
history
,
whereas
palaeontological
and
sedimentological
context
indicates
that
the
specimen
was
preserved
in
a
shallow
brackish
water
environment
.
Based
on
this
taphonomic
and
sedimentological
evidence
,
we
suggest
that
at
least
some
species
of
genus
Solemys
had
a
lifestyle
similar
to
extant
fresh
or
brackish
water
turtles
(
terrapins
)
and
that
the
histological
evidence
alone
for
a
terrestrial
lifestyle
is
misleading
.

Introduction
Turtles
are
among
the
most
abundant
and
diverse
components
in
Late
Cretaceous
vertebrate
faunas
.
In
southern
Europe
their
fossils
have
been
reported
in
multiple
basins
and
environments
.
In
the
Iberian
Peninsula
and
southern
France
the
chelonians
are
represented
by
homogenous
and
endemic
faunas
comprising
dortokids
(
Dortoka
)
,
bothremydids
(
Elochelys
,
Polysternon
,
Rosasia
)
and
solemydids
(
Solemys
and
other
forms
)
.
Solemys
,
a
primitive
cryptodire
,
was
the
last
member
of
a
Laurasian
family
that
evolved
in
North
America
and
western
Europe
between
the
Late
Jurassic
and
the
Late
Cretaceous
(
Lapparent
de
Broin
and
Murelaga
,
1999
)
.
This
genus
was
endemic
to
the
Iberian
Peninsula
and
southern
France
.
It
ranges
from
the
Campanian
to
the
late
Maastrichtian
(
Lapparent
de
Broin
,
2001
)
.
The
end
Cretaceous
extinction
of
the
Solemydidae
makes
it
difficult
to
infer
its
ecological
preferences
from
extant
taxa
.
Lapparent
de
Broin
and
Murelaga
(
1999
)
suggested
that
Solemys
might
have
lived
near
the
water
,
either
being
completely
terrestrial
or
semi-aquatic
.
Living
turtles
inhabit
a
wide
range
of
environments
(
land
,
ponds
,
lakes
,
streams
,
large
rivers
,
estuaries
,
ocean
,
etc.
)
.
According
to
lifestyle
,
they
have
been
distinguished
as
land
tortoises
,
marine
and
freshwater
turtles
(
Romer
,
1956
)
or
as
“
terrestrial
”
,
“
semi-aquatic
”
and
“
aquatic
”
(
Walker
,
1973
)
.
Landmark
study
of
shoulder
girdle
provided
additional
data
to
improve
this
ecological
classification
(
Depecker
et
al.
,
2006
)
.
These
authors
recognized
two
groups
of
highly
specialized
taxa
(
terrestrial
tortoises
and
marine
turtles
)
.
Within
the
group
of
fresh
and
brackish
water
turtles
two
patterns
were
distinguished
:
generalized
species
spending
time
in
both
terrestrial
and
aquatic
habitats
(
e.g.
Emydids
)
and
more
specialized
highly
aquatic
turtles
spending
little
time
out
of
water
(
e.g.
Trionychids
and
Carettochelyids
)
.
Histology
provides
a
way
of
testing
Solemys
lifestyle
hypotheses
since
,
the
bone
structure
of
the
carapace
of
extant
aquatic
and
terrestrial
turtles
reveals
histological
differences
(
Scheyer
and
Sander
,
2007
)
.
Thus
,
as
noted
by
these
authors
,
the
study
of
carapace
histology
in
extinct
turtles
with
rarely
preserved
or
absent
limb
bones
may
help
to
elucidate
their
lifestyles
.
Nevertheless
,
the
same
authors
noted
that
some
current
taxa
do
not
fit
the
general
pattern
.
In
this
sense
,
the
aim
of
the
present
paper
is
to
provide
new
data
about
the
paleoecology
of
the
extinct
genus
Solemys
considering
sedimentological
and
taphonomic
data
besides
histological
evidence
.
These
have
been
obtained
from
carapace
remains
found
at
Mina
Esquirol
site
,
a
new
early
Maastrichtian
locality
in
the
south-eastern
Pyrenees
belonging
to
the
Tremp
Formation
.

.
Geological
and
palaeontological
setting
The
Tremp
Formation
is
composed
of
continental
materials
deposited
in
different
basins
of
the
southern
Pyrenees
between
the
end
of
the
Cretaceous
and
the
beginnings
of
the
Paleogene
(
see
Rosell
et
al.
,
2001
for
further
details
)
.
The
composition
of
different
stratigraphic
sections
of
this
formation
shows
a
continuous
series
of
760
meters
of
thickness
in
the
Vallcebre
Syncline
(
North
of
Barcelona
,
south-eastern
Pyrenees
)
that
extends
from
the
early
Maastrichtian
to
the
Thanetian
(
Feist
and
Colombo
,
1983
and
Oms
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
There
,
most
of
the
fossil
vertebrate
evidence
consists
of
titanosaur
tracks
and
trackways
from
the
basalmost
levels
of
the
series
,
at
Fumanya
ichnosites
(
Schulp
and
Brokx
,
1999
and
Vila
et
al.
,
2008
and
references
therein
)
.
Except
for
the
fossil
turtle
reported
here
,
the
only
other
fossil
remains
associated
with
the
track
horizons
,
are
invertebrates
and
large
plant
remains
(
Vila
et
al.
,
2008
)
.
The
fossils
herein
described
were
discovered
at
Mina
Esquirol
ichnosite
on
July
,
2001
(
Fig.
1
)
.
This
site
,
which
is
part
of
the
larger
Fumanya
exposures
,
consists
of
a
subvertical
surface
of
ca.
2,000
m
2
cropping
out
the
early
Maastrichtian
“
marly
limestones
”
unit
,
the
basalmost
unit
of
the
Tremp
Formation
.
Based
on
sedimentological
data
,
the
depositional
environment
inferred
for
this
unit
is
an
extensive
and
transitional
mudflat
,
with
low
energy
conditions
(
Vila
et
al.
,
2005
and
Oms
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
On
top
of
the
unit
,
various
centimeter-scale
thin
marl
layers
(
referred
to
as
overbeds
)
occur
.
At
the
contact
of
the
marly
limestones
and
the
overbeds
and
within
the
overbeds
,
multiple
fossils
(
palm
leaves
and
log
impressions
and
compressions
,
accumulations
of
cheirolepidiaceae
conifer
axes
,
moulds
of
Pyrgulifera
gastropods
,
in
addition
to
thousands
of
titanosaur
ichnites
)
have
been
identified
.
The
turtle
specimen
described
here
was
collected
from
the
lower
overbed
,
and
was
in
contact
with
the
top
of
the
“
marly
limestones
”
unit
(

)
.

Methods
Measurements
of
turtle
bones
were
taken
from
the
original
specimen
(
IPS-23008
)
using
a
Vernier
caliper
with
an
accuracy
of
0.1
mm
.
Measurements
of
the
cast
of
carapace
were
taken
from

.
Thin
sections
of
the
bone
were
obtained
following
the
methodology
of
Chinsamy
and

Material
.
Fragments
of
posterior
peripheral
and
neural
plates
housed
at
the
Institut
Català
de
Paleontologia
collection
(
IPS-23008
)
.
Description
.
Fragments
of
peripheral
and
neural
plates
were
extracted
from
the
edge
of
an
in
situ
cast
of
a
carapace
(
Fig.
2
A
)
.
The
carapace
,
that
probably
was
originally
complete
,
measures
43
cm
wide
.
The
largest
bone
fragment
includes
the
posterior
peripheral
plates
and
measures
24
cm
long
(
Fig.
2
B
)
.
In
cross-section
this
fragment
is
0.4
cm
thick
.
Plate
boundaries
are
strongly
worn
,
nearly
imperceptible
,
probably
due
to
diagenetic
and/or
taphonomic
processes
.
The
ornamentation
consists
of
granulations
and
round-outlined
crests
of
up
to
1.5
mm
wide
(
Fig.
2
C
)
that
are
abundantly
worn
in
one
of
the
sides
.
Among
the
recovered
material
,
two
partial
connected
neural
plates
were
also
identified
(
Fig.
2
D
)
.
One
of
them
shows
a
hexagonal
shape
that
is
shorter
on
its
anterior
end
.
The
entire
fragment
measures
6.35
cm
long
and
it
is
covered
with
granulations
that
are
1
–
2
mm
in
diameter
.
The
histological
thin
sections
(
Fig.
3
)
reveal
a
diploe
structure
with
an
external
cortex
well
differentiated
from
the
internal
cancellous
bone
.
The
external
cortex
is
well
developed
,
consisting
of
lamellar
bone
tissue
.
Growth
marks
are
easily
visible
and
are
subparallel
to
the
surface
.
The
vascularization
is
low
with
few
and
scattered
vascular
canals
and
primary
osteons
.
Secondary
osteons
can
be
observed
in
the
most
internal
part
of
the
cortical
bone
.
The
cancellous
bone
consists
of
short
and
thick
trabeculae
composed
of
lamellar
bone
delimiting
small
to
medium-sized
vascular
spaces
.
Near
their
boundaries
,
secondary
osteons
can
also
be
observed
.
The
internal
cortex
is
more
vascularized
than
the
external
cortex
.
Remarks
.
Based
on
the
characters
of
the
ornamentation
,
consisting
of
granulations
and
vermiculations
on
the
surface
of
the
carapace
fragments
,
and
the
shape
of
the
neural
plates
,
the
Mina
Esquirol
specimen
is
referred
to
the
cryptodire
genus
Solemys
.
Because
of
the
absence
of
more
diagnostic
characters
,
the
specimen
can
not
be
assigned
to
either
of
its
two
described
species
,
S.
vermiculata
Lapparent
de
Broin
and
Murelaga
1996
and
S.
gaudryi
Matheron
1869
.
The
maximum
size
of
the
shell
for
the
species
S.
vermiculata
is
68.5
×
56
cm
(
after
Lapparent
de
Broin
and
Murelaga
,
1999
)
whereas
the
estimated
size
for
the
Mina
Esquirol
specimen
is
about
40
–
50
cm
wide
.
According
to
these
measurements
,
we
suggest
that
the
remains
from
Mina
Esquirol
correspond
to
an
adult
individual
.

.
Depositional
environment
and
taphonomic
data
Several
lines
of
evidence
indicate
that
specimen
IPS-23008
was
deposited
in
a
shallow
water
environment
.
The
marly
limestones
unit
,
organized
in
milimeter
to
centimeter
laminations
with
neither
tractive
sedimentary
structures
nor
coarse
clastics
,
has
been
interpreted
as
an
extensive
carbonate
mudflat
in
a
very
low
energy
palaeoenvironment
(
Vila
et
al.
,
2005
and
Oms
et
al.
,
2007
)
.
The
palaeontological
content
of
such
unit
includes
brackish
ostracods
(
e.g.
Neocyprideis
)
and
molluscs
(
e.g
Cerithium
,
Cerastoderma
,
Corbicula
,
“
Ostrea
”
,
Pyrgulifera
,
Saccostrea
)
,
stingray
spines
,
dinosaur
tracks
and
terrestrial
plants
(
Marmi
et
al.
,
2008a
)
.
On
one
hand
,
ostracod
assemblages
,
autochthonous
clumps
of
Saccostrea
oysters
and
stingray
spines
are
consistent
with
a
brackish
water
environment
close
to
the
sea
.
On
the
other
hand
,
dinosaur
tracks
and
plant
remains
provide
strong
evidence
for
a
continental
influence
.
Low
energy
depositional
conditions
favoured
the
preservation
of
dinosaur
tracks
and
are
consistent
with
a
random
deposition
of
floating
palm
leaves
and
large
logs
(
Vila
et
al.
,
2005
,
Marmi
et
al.
,
2008a
and
Marmi
et
al.
,
2008b
)
.
The
lack
of
preferential
orientation
for
these
plant
megarrests
supports
the
absence
of
moderate
to
strong
currents
(
Riera
et
al.
,
submmited
)
.
Originally
,
the
carapace
of
Solemys
was
complete
or
almost
complete
but
most
of
shell
bones
were
lost
due
to
erosion
.

A
clearly
shows
the
outline
of
the
original
carapace
preserving
peripheral
fragments
in
their
original
position
before
the
excavation
.
The
peripheral
fragments
and
neural
plates
lack
evidence
of
significant
weathering
or
other
pre-burial
modification
,
such
as
abrasion
,
scavenging
or
trampling
(

.

Discussion
Habitat
preferences
of
the
extinct
genus
Solemys
are
not
clear
.
Lapparent
de
Broin
and
Murelaga
(
1999
)
stated
that
Solemys
shared
the
morphological
character
of
arms
covered
by
osteoscutes
with
terrestrial
testudinids
.
However
,
these
authors
did
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
it
might
inhabit
shallow
waters
.
In
accordance
with
this
,
Solemys
has
been
reported
from
a
wide
variety
of
environments
of
deposition
,
including
deltaic
and
lagoonal
environments
(
Murelaga
and
Canudo
,
2005
)
and
river
floodplains
(
Company
,
2005
)
.
Nevertheless
,
most
of
the
material
reported
in
the
literature
is
highly
fragmentary
suggesting
a
significant
amount
of
transportation
,
so
the
environment
of
deposition
can
not
be
interpreted
as
the
environment
in
which
the
species
lived
.
Histological
evidence
provides
additional
support
for
a
terrestrial
mode
of
life
.
The
histology
of
Mina
Esquirol
specimen
of
Solemys
is
similar
to
that
of
fully
terrestrial
turtles
:
no
homogenization
of
cortical
and
cancellous
bone
,
low
vascularization
of
external
cortex
and
generally
shorter
and
thicker
trabeculae
of
cancellous
bone
.
Neither
of
these
characteristics
is
typical
of
an
aquatic
lifestyle
,
which
favours
the
reduction
of
overall
shell
bone
tissue
(
Scheyer
and
Sander
,
2007
)
.
Nonetheless
,
Solemys
has
a
moderately
vascularized
internal
cortex
,
a
feature
that
is
rare
to
absent
in
the
internal
cortex
of
terrestrial
taxa
.
As
indicated
by
Scheyer
and
Sander
(
2007
)
,
histological
data
of
the
carapace
bones
can
be
very
useful
to
elucidate
lifestyles
of
extinct
turtles
,
especially
those
lacking
limbs
.
However
,
in
this
work
,
only
one
fully
terrestrial
species
was
tested
(
Geochelone
pardalis
)
and
the
other
genera
included
in
the
“
terrestrial
”
sample
were
Cuora
and
Terrapene
that
contain
some
aquatic
species
.
Unfortunately
,
these
authors
do
not
tested
if
the
“
terrestrial
”
histological
pattern
found
in
the
Cuora
and
Terrapene
studied
species
is
due
to
their
ecology
or
if
it
is
genus
specific
.
Thus
,
histological
data
alone
should
be
used
with
caution
to
elucidate
the
lifestyle
of
the
Mina
Esquirol
specimen
to
avoid
erroneous
inferences
.
Conclusions
about
the
habitat
of
extinct
terrestrial
chelonians
can
be
independently
tested
by
taphonomic
and
paleoenvironmental
data
.
Taphonomic
research
in
extant
freshwater
turtles
provides
an
understanding
of
rates
of
decay
and
disarticulation
and
indicates
the
variation
in
time
for
osteological
elements
to
disarticulate
.
Experimental
studies
have
also
provided
data
that
can
be
used
to
estimate
the
time
between
death
and
burial
for
fossil
specimens
(
Brand
et
al.
,
2003
)
.
These
studies
demonstrate
that
after
death
,
skull
and
limb
bones
separate
from
the
body
early
whereas
the
shell
is
the
last
to
disarticulate
(
Brand
et
al.
,
2000
)
.
Based
on
these
data
,
we
can
interpret
the
taphonomic
history
of
the
Solemys
specimen
from
Mina
Esquirol
.
Firstly
,
all
the
sedimentological
evidence
indicates
that
the
specimen
of
Mina
Esquirol
was
deposited
in
(
shallow
)
water
.
This
,
as
also
indicated
by
taphonomic
experiments
(
Brand
et
al.
,
2003
)
,
would
considerably
reduce
the
effects
of
weathering
in
bones
since
they
are
not
exposed
preventing
scavenging
,
trampling
or
other
biostratinomic
processes
.
The
lack
of
significant
weathering
in
the
IPS-23008
specimen
agrees
with
the
lower
weathering
effects
inferred
by
Behrensmeyer
(
1978
)
for
vertebrates
preserved
in
swampy
environments
.
Brand
et
al.
,
2000
and
Brand
et
al.
,
2003
also
reported
empirically
that
the
shortest
disarticulation
times
occurred
in
fresh
and
seawater
;
on
the
other
hand
in
terrestrial
dry
environments
the
disarticulation
took
longer
and
its
length
was
highly
variable
.
A
subtropical
wet
climate
has
been
inferred
for
the
Vallcebre
Syncline
during
the
Late
Cretaceous
(
García-Vallès
et
al.
,
1993
)
,
suggesting
a
warm
water
temperature
that
could
enable
a
fast
disarticulation
.
Secondly
,
the
specimen
from
Mina
Esquirol
was
preserved
as
a
complete
shell
(
see
Fig.
2
A
)
.
Brand
et
al.
(
2003
)
noted
that
the
breakup
of
the
shell
begins
with
the
disarticulation
of
peripheral
bones
,
always
occurring
by
separation
of
complete
bones
from
each
other
at
the
sutures
,
not
by
breaking
of
bones
.
The
peripheral
region
of
the
specimen
IPS-23008
was
preserved
fully
articulated
.
The
preservation
of
an
articulated
shell
is
indicative
of
an
early
burial
with
very
short
time
for
shell
disarticulation
.
Experiments
indicate
that
skeleton
of
turtles
immersed
in
water
disarticulated
within
20
weeks
(
Brand
et
al.
,
2000
)
,
so
this
specimen
was
probably
buried
within
a
maximum
of
15
–
30
weeks
or
less
.
The
fact
that
the
Mina
Esquirol
carapace
was
probably
complete
,
and
abrasion
,
scavenging
and
trampling
marks
are
absent
,
is
consistent
with
a
short
biostratinomic
history
.
Therefore
,
we
suggest
that
after
death
,
the
Mina
Esquirol
specimen
buried
in
the
carbonated
mud
,
floating
for
at
most
a
few
short
time
.
This
implies
a
short
distance
transport
and
supports
the
hypothesis
that
Solemys
lived
in
or
very
close
to
the
depositional
environment
.
As
indicated
above
,
palaeontological
indicators
and
sedimentologic
evidence
strongly
indicates
that
the
Mina
Esquirol
specimen
was
preserved
in
a
nearshore
environment
(
e.g.
transitional
brackish
mudflat
)
.
Together
,
the
taphonomic
history
and
the
environment
of
deposition
in
which
it
is
preserved
suggest
that
Solemys
from
Mina
Esquirol
was
not
a
fully
terrestrial
turtle
and
probably
had
an
ecology
similar
to
the
current
diamondback
terrapin
(
Malaclemys
terrapin
)
that
inhabits
brackish
water
areas
from
the
eastern
coast
of
United
States
where
eat
mollusks
,
crabs
and
small
fishes
(
Ernst
et
al.
,
1994
)
.
The
data
available
suggests
that
a
fully
terrestrial
lifestyle
is
unlikely
because
the
paleoenvironment
inferred
would
be
strongly
unsuitable
for
this
kind
of
turtle
,
being
more
probable
the
fossilization
for
an
aquatic
species
well
adapted
to
swim
in
brackish
waters
.
However
,
as
it
is
known
for
current
species
of
Cuora
and
Terrapene
,
the
present
study
is
unable
to
resolve
if
all
species
within
genus
Solemys
were
semi-aquatic
like
current
terrapins
or
if
it
was
a
characteristic
of
some
species
while
others
were
fully
terrestrial
.
Further
studies
are
required
in
localities
with
well-preserved
specimens
and
good
paleoenvironmental
data
available
to
resolve
this
question
.
This
study
demonstrates
that
paleoecological
data
contradicts
the
histological
data
.
Modern
analogues
that
show
a
similar
pattern
are
Mauremys
mutica
and
Pangshura
tentoria
.
Both
of
which
are
extant
Geoemydidae
species
inhabiting
swamps
,
marshes
,
ponds
and
creeks
of
rivers
,
in
spite
of
having
a
carapace
bone
structure
similar
to
terrestrial
taxa
(
Scheyer
and
Sander
,
2007
)
.
Thus
,
we
conclude
that
,
on
balance
,
taphonomic
and
sedimentological
evidence
are
more
robust
than
histology
,
favouring
the
interpretation
that
the
specimen
from
Mina
Esquirol
inhabited
transitional
swampy
and
shallow-water
environments
.
