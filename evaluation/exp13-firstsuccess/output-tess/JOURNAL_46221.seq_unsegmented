Abstract
Coral
reefs
constitute
real
oasis
sheltering
for
about
one
third
of
the
identiﬁed
ﬁshes
,
representing
a
major
advantage
for
the
economy
and
tourism
of
many
tropical
countries
.
However
it
is
paradoxical
to
notice
that
their
formation
at
the
cellular
level
or
even
at
the
scale
of
the
organism
is
still
poorly
known
.
Effectively
,
biomineralisation
,
the
process
that
is
at
the
basis
of
their
ediﬁcation
,
is
always
the
subject
of
numerous
researches
.
Two
combined
mechanisms
lead
to
the
formation
of
a
biomineral
,
the
synthesis/secretion
of
macromolecules
referred
to
as
‘
organic
matrix
’
,
and
the
transport
of
ions
(
calcium
,
bicarbonates
and
protons
in
the
case
of
calciﬁcation
)
to
the
mineralising
site
.
This
review
shows
a
view
of
the
works
carried
out
on
biominerali
—
sation
in
scleractinian
corals
,
including
some
aspects
on
the
control
of
calciﬁcation
by
environmental
parameters
.
It
also
gives
insights
into
the
biological
basis
of
the
use
of
coral
skeletons
as
environmental
archives
in
palaeo
—
oceanography
.

Introduction
“
The
organic
forces
separate
the
atoms
of
carbonate
of
lime
,
one
by
one
,
from
the
foaming
breakers
,
and
unite
them
into
a
symmetrical
structure
.
Let
the
hurricane
tear
up
its
thousand
huge
fragments
;
yet
what
will
that
tell
against
the
accumulated
labour
of
myriads
of
architects
at
work
night
and
day
,
month
after
month
.
Thus
do
we
see
the
soft
and
gelatinous
body
of
polypus
,
through
the
agency
of
the
vital
laws
,
conquering
the
great
mechanical
power
of
the
waves
of
an
ocean
,
which
neither
the
art
of
man
nor
the
inanimate
works
of
nature
could
successfully
resist
.
”
Charles
Darwin
,
in
:
Journal
of
researches
into
the
natural
history
and
geology
of
the
countries
visited
during
the
voyage
round
the
world
of
H.M.S.
Beagle
under
command
of
Captain
Fitz
Roy
London
,
John
Murray
Eds
,
Albemarle
Street
,
1845
.
Coral
reefs
constitute
the
most
important
bioconstruction
of
the
world
with
a
calciﬁcation
rate
of
about
2-6
kgCaCO3
m
’
2
yr
’
1
[
5
]
and
a
distribution
over
about
284
300
km2
[
80
]
.
However
,
who
knows
that
this
huge
construction
results
from
the
work
of
small
colonial
organisms
related
to
hydra
,
medusa
or
sea
anemone
,
the
reef-building
corals
?
These
reefs
are
of
major
importance
,
not
only
for
marine
ecosystems
and
biodiversity
(
tropical
reefs
are
the
most
productive
marine
ecosystem
and
would
host
almost
a
third
of
all
world
ﬁshes
)
,
but
also
for
the
economy
of
numerous
countries
(
tourism
,
ﬁshing
...
)
,
for
palaeoclimatology
or
geology
studies
...
[
7,65,94
]
.
Several
applications
of
coral
reefs
are
known
,
from
drugs
isolated
from
organisms
[
32
]
to
the
use
of
coral
skeleton
as
bio-implants
for
human
surgery
[
24,30
]
.
However
,
in
light
of
global
change
,
a
decline
of
coral
reefs
has
been
described
worldwide
[
l2
,52,68,79
]
.
In
spite
of
this
major
importance
,
reef
formation
remains
poorly
known
.
Pioneering
work
by
Darwin
[
21
]
was
followed
by
ﬁner
description
of
coral
calciﬁcation
(
see
[
64,69
]
and
later
[
9
]
)
.
Nevertheless
,
real
physiological
studies
started
after
1950
with
the
works
of
Muscatine
(
see
review
in
[
6
]
)
.
At
the
dawn
of
the
21st
century
,
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
coral
calciﬁcation
are
still
almost
unknown
.
As
other
biominerals
,
coral
skeleton
formation
needs
simultaneously
a
supply
of
ions
and
a
control
by
an
organic
framework
,
the
organic
matrix
,
present
inside
the
skeleton
.
After
a
brief
description
of
coral
anatomy
,
we
present
in
this
review
recent
data
regarding
control
of
calciﬁcation
by
ions
and
organic
matrix
and
some
data
explaining
relationships
between
light
and
calciﬁcation
.
Environmental
control
of
coral
calciﬁcation
,
as
well
as
the
experimental
bases
of
the
use
of
coral
skeletons
as
environmental
archives
,
will
also
be
presented
.
This
review
is
mainly
based
upon
results
obtained
at
the
‘
Centre
scientiﬁque
de
Monaco
’
,
which
develops
studies
on
coral
biology
from
the
ecosystem
to
the
colony
,
the
microcolony
,
the
cell
,
and
the
molecule
(
for
more
details

other
recent
reviews

)
.

Deﬁnitions
If
the
term
‘
coral
’
is
broadly
used
,
paradoxically
it
has
no
valid
taxonomic
deﬁnition
.
‘
Coral
’
initially
referred
to
the
Mediterranean
coral
,
Corallium
rubrum
(
Anthozoa
:
Octocorallia
)
with
a
calcitic
skeleton
.
Afterwards
,
it
was
used
to
name
other
Octocorallians
,
like
the
blue
coral
(
Heliopora
)
,
but
also
Hexacorallians
,
like
the
black
coral
with
horny
skeleton
,
Antipathes
,
or
reef-building
corals
(
Scleractinians
or
Madreporaria
)
with
aragonitic
skeleton
,
or
even
Hydrozoans
like
the
ﬁre
coral
(
M
illepora
)
.
To
throw
people
into
confusion
,
D.
Allemand
et
al.
/
C.
R.
Palevol

(

)
453-467 455
‘
coral
’
also
designates
Octocorallia
without
hard
skeleton
,
the
Alcyonarians
(
soft
corals
!
)
.
Scleractinian
corals
are
known
for
their
skeleton
and
are
,
in
this
case
,
called
‘
reef-building
corals
’
or
hermatypic
corals
(
herm
=
reef
)
.
Hermatypic
corals
host
in
their
tissues
unicellular
Dinoﬂagellates
symbionts
,
commonly
called
zooxanthellae
(
Symbiodinium
sp
.
)
[
76
]
.
But
all
Scleractinians
are
not
reef
builders
(
ahermatypic
corals
)
,
even
if
they
are
characterized
by
their
aragonitic
skeleton
.
3
.
Morpho-functional
anatomy
The
coral
skeleton
is
extracellular
,
located
at
the
base
of
coral
tissue
,
like
a
ﬁnger
covered
by
a
glove
.
Hermatypic
corals
are
modular
animals
,
constituted
of
similar
units
,
the
polyps
resulting
from
a
clonal
reproduction
(
asexual
reproduction
by
budding
)
.
Each
polyp
looks
like
a
bag
whose
walls
are
made
by
two
layers
of
cells
,
an
ectodermal
layer
,
and
an
endodermal
layer
,
separated
by
a
network
of
collagen
,
called
mesoglea
.
The
endodermal
cell
layer
delimits
a
cavity
,
the
coelenteron
,
with
only
one
opening
,
the
mouth
,
surrounded
by
tentacles
(
of
a
multiple
of
6
=
Hexacorallia
)
.
This
cavity
acts
simultaneously
as
a
gastric
and
circulatory
cavity
between
polyps
,
and
is
therefore
also
called
gastro-vascular
cavity
.
Polyps
are
linked
together
by
the
coenosarc
made
by
an
oral
(
facing
sea
water
)
and
an
aboral
(
facing
skeleton
)
epithelium
,
each
of
them
being
composed
of
an
ectodermal
and
an
endodermal
cell
layer
(
Fig.
1
)
.
Ectoderm
and
endoderm
are
differentiated
between
oral
and
aboral
layers
:
most
of
zooxanthellae
are
located
within
the
oral
endoderm
,
whereas
only
a
few
are
found
in
the
aboral
endoderm
.
The
oral
ectoderm
is
thick
(
10
to
20
um
)
and
rich
in
cnidocytes
,
whereas
the
aboral
ectoderm
,
also
called
calicoblastic
epithelium
,
is
ﬂat
(
0.5
to
3
pm
)
and
does
not
possess
cnidocytes
.
Calicoblastic
epithelium
is
responsible
for
the
formation
of
the
aragonitic
skeleton
.
Calicoblastic
cells
are
long
(
10
to
100
um
)
,
highly
interdigitated
and
overlap
each
other
.
They
contain
numerous
mitochondria
,
suggesting
an
active
metabolic
role
.
Skeletogenic
cells
are
connected
by
desmosome
junctions
[
48
,
Tambutté
and
Allemand
,
unpublished
data
]
.
They
are
attached
to
the
exoskeleton
by
specialized
cells
,
called
desmocytes
[
62
]
.
Cells
are
often
separated
by
large
intercellular
spaces
that
may
contain
circular
vesicles
(
50-70
nm
in
diameter
)
thought
to
function
in
exocytotic
transport
of
organic
matrix
[
48
]
.
Consequently
,
the
skeletogenic
process
occurs
in
a
‘
biologically-controlled
medium
’
and
is
separated
from
the
external
seawater
by
four
layers
of
cells
,
i.e.
at
least
40-50
pm
thick
.

.
Biomineralisation
:
ions
and
organic
molecules
Composition
of
biominerals
includes
two
fractions
,
one
mineral
and
one
organic
,
called
organic
matrix
,
the
amount
of
each
varying
among
species
.
In
Scleractinian
corals
,
skeleton
is
made
of
calcium
carbonate
(
CaCO3
)
crystallized
in
aragonite
(
orthorhombic
system
)
.
In
order
to
build
their
skeleton
,
corals
have
to
supply
calcium
and
inorganic
carbon
from
ambient
seawater
to
the
calciﬁcation
site
but
also
to
eliminate
protons
resulting
from
the
mineralising
process
:
Caz
+
Hco
;
:
CaCO3
+
H
+
Epithelial
transport
of
molecules
can
be
achieved
by
two
mechanisms
:
a
paracellular
pathway
,
between
cells
(
in
this
case
,
transport
of
the
molecule
is
only
driven
by
its
chemical
gradient
,
transport
is
diffusional
and
passive
)
,
or
a
transcellular
pathway
through
cells
.
In
this
last
case
,
the
molecule
needs
to
enter
the
cell
,
cross
the
cell
and
then
exit
.
Thus
the
transport
is
active
,
against
a
gradient
with
energy
supply
.
Transport
of
charged
species
across
the
hydrophobic
cell
membrane
requires
speciﬁc
carrier
proteins
.
Study
of
coral
calciﬁcation
was
for
a
long
time
limited
due
to
methodological
problems
linked
with
the
use
of
radioisotopes
,
particularly
45
Ca
[
4
]
.
Before
1990
,
most
of
coral
scientists
made
their
experiences
with
freshly-cut
branches
of
corals
(
like
Acropora
or
Stylophora
)
,
leading
to
a
naked
skeleton
whose
porosity
facilitated
the
unspeciﬁc
adsorption
of
45Ca
.
Furthermore
,
the
presence
of
a
large
volume
inside
the
coelenteric
cavity
led
to
errors
,
because
the
amount
of
radioactive
calcium
in
this
cavity
was
about
53
%
of
total
amount
absorbed
by
the
colony
after
30
min
of
incubation
with
45Ca-labelled
seawater
[
83
]
.
Therefore
,
the
lack
of
rinsing
this
cavity
induced
an
important
error
.
In
order
to
cope
with
this
problem
,
researchers
from
the
‘
Centre
scientiﬁque
de
Monaco
’
have
set
up
two
important
technological
improvements
:
(

)
a
speciﬁc
preparation
of
a
1-cm-long
coral
colony

Calcium
Using
a
kinetic
isotopic
approach
,
it
has
been
shown
that
radioactive
calcium
is
incorporated
into
the
skeleton
of
Stylophora
pistillata
only
2-4
min
after
its
addition
in
the
surrounding
seawater
[
85
]
,
suggesting
that
transepithelial
transport
must
be
huge
and
very
efﬁcient
.
In
this
species
,
calcium
ﬂux
is
about
140
nmol

’

,
but
values
as
high
as
1700
nmol

have
been
measured
in
Acrapora

[

]
.
Calcium
ﬂuxes
measured
in
mammalian
kidney
or
intestine
are
much
lower
(
about
50
to
250
nmol
h
’
l
cm

,
[
11
]
)
.
Within
the
microcolony
,
the
calcium
pool
available
for
calciﬁcation
is
small
and
presents
a
very
high
turnover
rate
(
i.e.
2
min
,
[
85
]
)
.
By
a
pharmacological
approach
,
using
calcium
channel
inhibitors
,
two
authors
[
54,85
]
demonstrated
that
transepithelial
calcium
transport
involves
at
least
one
transcellular
pathway
.
In
the
coral
Stylophora
pistillata
,
Tambutté
et
al.
[
85
]
showed
that
transport
across
oral
layers
was
passive
,
the
diffusional
calcium
ﬂux
between
external
sea
water
and
the
coelenteric
ﬂuid
being
13-fold
higher
than
the
rate
of
calciﬁcation
(

)
,
suggesting
that
this
step
is
not
limiting
.
This
result
has
been
conﬁrmed
by
Bénazet-Tambutté
et
al.
[
85
]
using
other
approaches
as
Ussing
chambers
.
These
authors
showed
that
transepithelial
ion
transport
across
oral
layers
in
the
coral
Heliofungia
actimformis
and
the
sea
anemone
Anemonia
viridis
is
passive
and
diffusional
.
Nevertheless
,
other
data
obtained
in
the
coral
Galaxea
fascicularis
showed
that
an
active
transepithelial
transport
might
occur
within
oral
layers
[
95
]
,
suggesting
species
speciﬁcity
.
As
the
major
transepithelial
step
does
not
occur
at
the
oral
level
in
Stylophora
pistillata
,
we
investigated
where
it
could
be
located
.
Combining
pharmacological
and
isotopic
approaches
,
Tambutté
et
al.
[
85
]
showed
that
the
calicoblastic
epithelium
is
the
site
of
active
transport
.
This
transcellular
pathway
involves
L-type
Ca2
+
channel
proteins
[
85
]
.
The
0.1
subunit
of
this
channel
has
been
cloned
and
immuno-localized
on
the
calicoblastic
epithelium
[
99
]
.
This
protein
,
of
a
calculated
molecular
mass
of
213.2
kDa
(
accession
number
,
Genbank
database
:
U64465
)
shares
with
the
rabbit
0.1
C
subunit
52.5
%
and
86
%
identities
and
conservative
substitutions
,
respectively
.
Opening
of
L-type
Ca
channel
is
normally
regulated
by
membrane
depolarisation
,
and
its
presence
is
generally
restricted
to
excitable
cells
.
Therefore
,
its
presence
within
a
transporting
epithelium
carrying
out
large
and
permanent
Ca2
+
ﬂuxes
appears
surprising
.
This
paradox
may
be
explained
by
preliminary
electrophysiological
experiments
(
Zoccola
et
al.
,
unpublished
results
)
showing
that
,
in
spite
of
a
strong
homology
to
L-type
Ca
channel
,
the
Stylophara
calcium
channel
is
not
regulated
by
voltage
.
Isa
et
al.
[
47
]
and
Ip
et
al.
[
44
]
demonstrated
the
existence
of
a
Ca2
+
—
ATPase
activity
in
the
homogenates
of
coral
tissues
.
Since
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
this
ATPase
functions
as
an
obligatory
Ca2
+
/
H
+
exchanger
with
a
probable
stoichiometry
of
1
to
1
[
75
]
,
McConnaughey
[
57

(
see
also

that
the
H

generated
by
CaCO3
precipitation
is
removed
by
Ca2

—
ATPase-mediated
Ca2

I-1

exchange
.
Preliminaiy
results
using
a
molecular
biology
approach
demonstrated
the
presence
of
this
Ca2

ATPase
within
the
calicoblastic
cells
[

.

At

,
no

is
available
concerning

In
order
to

the

,
the

carbon
incorporation
underestimates
the
rate
of
calciﬁcation

compared
to
45
Ca
incorporation
,
by
40-60
%
.
This
suggests
,
as
previously
shown
by
Goreau
[

and
Erez
[
25

,
that
part
(
about
60-70
%
)
of
the
carbon
used
for
CaCO3
formation
may
originate
from
respired
CO2

Carbonic
anhydrase
,
which
plays
a
key
role
in
numerous
physiological
processes
in
vertebrates
and
invertebrates
[

is
also
involved
in

in

Carbonic

[

.
Its
inhibition
by
ethoxyzolamide
,
a
permeant
inhibitor
,
reduces
by
80
%
the
rate
of
calciﬁcation
,
suggesting
that
carbonic
anhydrase
increases
the
rate
of
equilibration
between

and

[

(
see

.
It
is
signiﬁcant
that
calicoblastic
cells
are
particularly
rich
in
mitochondria
[
48
]
and
that

Calciﬁcation
has
been
shown
to
be
completely
inhibited
by
the
anion
channel
inhibitor
,
DIDS
[
85
]
(
Fig.

)
,
suggesting
that
an
anion
carrier
is
involved
in
the
transport
of
DIC
across
the
calicoblastic
cells
.
This
anion
carrier
is
likely
located
on
the
calicoblastic
plasma
membrane
adjacent
to
the
skeleton
.
Consequently
,
sources
of
DIC
are
(
1
)
metabolic
CO2
and
(
2
)
HCO3
’
directly
absorbed
by
the
calicoblastic
cells
by
a
mechanism
remaining
totally
unknown
(
HCO3
’
channel
as
reported
in
the
sea
anemone
by
[
34
]
)
.
The
cytoplasmic
carbonic
anhydrase
would
carry
out
the
equilibrium
between
these
two
forms
.
An
anion
exchanger
(
perhaps
the
Cl
’
/
HCO3
’
antiport
known
for
its
sensitivity
to
DIDS
,
[
27
]
)
could
then
transfer
HCO3
’
to
the
site
of
calciﬁcation
(
secondary
active
transport
)
.
This
raises
the
question
of
the
composition
of
the
ﬂuids
within
the
sub-calicoblastic
space
.
Nothing
is
known
about
the
composition
of
this
ﬂuid
in
corals
,
and
little
is
known
in
other
calcifying
animals
.
It
seems
,
however
,
that
the
inorganic
carbon
content
of
this
ﬂuid
is
higher
than
that
of
the
surrounding
medium
in
order
to
reach
the
solubility
product
.
In
molluscs
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
dissolved
inorganic
carbon
content
of
the
extrapallial
ﬂuid
is
at
least
2-fold
higher
than
that
of
seawater
[
16
]
.
Among
the
vertebrates
,
the
ﬂuid
surrounding
the
otolith
in
ﬁshes
(
i.e.
the
otolymph
)
contains
about
2-3
fold
more
HCO3
’
than
the
blood
[
66
]
and
concentrations
of
HCO3
’
as
high
as
130
mM
have
been
reported
in
the
uterine
ﬂuid
of
chickens
during
eggshell
formation
[
63
]
.
These
data
strongly
suggest
that
an
active
mechanism
of
transport
is
involved
to
supply
carbon
to
the
site
of
calciﬁcation
.
4.1.3
.
pH
regulation
Nothing
is
known
about
pH
regulation
during
calciﬁcation
process
.
As
stated
above
,
CaCO3
production
leads
to
H
+
production
.
These
H
+
may
be
removed
from
the
site
of
calciﬁcation
by
the
antiport
Ca2
+
/
H+ATP
ase
.
Preliminary
results
(
Zoccola
et
al.
,
in
prep
.
)
suggest
that
regulation
of
pH
in
the
calicoblastic
cells
may
involve
an
H
+
—
ATPase
rather
than
classic
systems
such
as
Na

(

Organic
matrix
It
is
now
ﬁrmly
established
that
organic
matrix
(
OM
)
plays
a
major
role
in
biomineralisation
:
crystal
nucleation
,
micro
-
and
macro-regulation
of
crystal
morphology
,
mineral
characteristics
...
[
26,90,91
]
.
As
in
all
other
biominerals
,
coral
skeleton
contains
an
organic
matrix
that
represents
less
than
0.01
%
of
the
total
weight
of
dry
skeleton
[
14
]
.
While
small
in
quantity
,
this
OM
is
nevertheless
essential
for
controlling
the
formation
of
CaCO3
crystals
,
since
inhibition
of
the
organic
matrix
synthesis
by
emetin
or
cycloheximide
,
or
inhibition
of
the
post-translational
glycosylation
of
the
proteins
by
tunicamycin
,
almost
instantaneously
stops
the
calciﬁcation
process
[
1
]
.
It
should
be
noted
that
these
inhibitors
do
not
simultaneously
affect
photosynthesis
and
respiration
.
Biochemical
composition
of
OM
in
corals
is
poorly
known
,
but
the
presence
of
proteins
,
polysaccharides
,
glycosaminoglycanes
[
14

as
well
as
of
lipids
[
98
]
and
chitin
[
88
]
has
been
reported
in
some
species
.
While
this
notion
is
presently
questioned
(
see
[
67
]
)
,
OM
is
usually
separated
into
soluble
and
insoluble
matrices
.
The
soluble
fraction
of
this
organic
matrix
is

While
the

of
OM
of

have
been

isolated
from

This
protein
,
of
a
molecular
weight
of
53

,
contains
298
amino
acids
,
arranged
in
tandem
repeats
of
about
30
amino

rich
in
cystein
,
serine
and
glycine
.
There
are
only
few
(
less
than
10
%
)
acidic
amino

.
This
protein
shows
no
homology
with
known
proteins
in
databases
.
Very
few
data
exist
on
the
metabolism
of

.
Using
14C-labelled
aspartic
acid
as
a
precursor
of
organic
matrix
,
Allemand
et
al.
[

]
showed
that
this
amino
acid
is
rapidly
incorporated
into
tissue
proteins
from
the
external
medium
,
suggesting
(
1
'
)
that
the
biosynthetic
pathway
is
very
efﬁcient
and
(
ii

that
no
intracellular
pool
of
aspartic

is
present
in
coral
tissue
.
After
a
lag
phase
of
20
min
,
organic
matrix
proteins
are
incorporated
within
the
skeleton
.
This
lag
time
likely
represents
the
exocytosis
of
organic
matrix
and
its
incorporation
into
the
CaCO3
crystal
.
Thus
depositions
of
organic
and
inorganic
fractions
of
the
skeleton
are
performed
simultaneously
and
not
sequentially
,
as
suggested
in
other
biominerals
,
such
as
ﬁsh
otoliths
[
60
]
.
Therefore
,
calciﬁcation
in
hermatypic
corals
is
controlled
both
by
the
cellular
supply
of
ions
(
Ca2
+
,
HCO3
’
)
and
the
organic
matrix
.
The
rate
of
ion
transport
and
organic
matrix
synthesis
and
exocytosis
is
very
high
(
<
2
min
)
.
Consequently
,
calciﬁcation
is
a
highly
biologically
controlled
mechanism
.

Interactions
between
photosynthesis
and
calciﬁcation
Major
calcifying
organisms
are
also
phototrophs
,
either
directly
(
coccolithophorids
)
or
indirectly
through
symbiosis
(
foraminifera
,
reef-building
corals
)
.
All
these
organisms
are
responsible
for
the
major
part
of
the
production
of
CaCO3
of
the
earth
.
In
these
organisms
,
calciﬁcation
is
highly
dependent
on
light
,
and
values
of
light-enhanced
calciﬁcation
up
to
127
have
been
reported
,
even
if
the
mean
stimulation
value
is
around
3
(
review
by
[
36
]
)
.
However
,
mechanisms
underlying
these
interactions
are
not
known
and
even
the
terminology
is
discussed
between
light-enhanced
or
dark-repressed
calciﬁcation
[
54
]
(
see
discussion
in
[
36
]
)
.
Several
mechanisms
have
been
hypothesized
to
explain
these
interactions
:
o
modiﬁcation
of
the
DIC
equilibrium
within
coral
tissues
caused
by
C02
uptake
for
photosynthesis
[
40,58
]
;
o
production
of
energy
by
photosynthesis
[
l3
]
;
o
production
of
02
by
photosynthesis
[
74
]
;
o
removal
of
inhibiting
substances
[
77
]
;
o
synthesis
by
symbionts
of
organic
matrix
molecules
or
precursors
[
61
]
.
Modiﬁcation
of
DIC
equilibrium
may
involve
either
photosynthetic
stimulation
of
calciﬁcation
by
lowering
the
CO2
partial
pressure
in
the
coral
tissue
,
thus
favouring
carbonate
precipitation
[
39,40
]
(
see
Fig.
Fig.
3A
)
or
dehydration
of
HCO3
’
to
CO2
by
H
+
produced
during
calciﬁcation
,
in
turn
stimulating
photosynthesis
[
57,58
]
(
see
3B
)
.
Both
hypotheses
assume
that
HCO3
’
freely
diffuses
into
the
coelenteric
cavity
,
which
,
as
shown
above
,
is
unlikely
to
be
the
case
.
Furthermore
,
Furla
et
al.
[
34
]
showed
that
lightenhanced
calciﬁcation
is
a
late
process
,
occurring
only
10
min
after
the
onset
of
the
photosynthetic
process
.
An
alternative
mechanism
may
involve
photosynthesis-induced
OH
’
secretion
within
the
coelenteric
cavity
(
Fig.
3C
)
.
This
light-dependent
OH
’
secretion
may
neutralize
H
’
produced
by
CaCO3
precipitation
,
thus
allowing
calciﬁcation
to
proceed
.
The
net
rate
of
OH
’
efﬂux
under
saturating
irradiance
is
3.55
nequiv
min
’
1
mg
’
lPmtem
[
33
]
,
while
calciﬁcation
in
the
scleractinian
coral
Stylophara
pistillata
occurs
at
a
rate
of
0.98
nequiv
min
’
l
mg
’
lPmtein
[
85
]
,
i.e.
at
a
rate
3.6-fold
higher
.
Notwithstanding
the
fact
that
such
a
comparison
between
two
phylogenetically
distinct
organisms
may
not
be
valid
,
it
can
be
tentatively
suggested
that
OH
’
efﬂux
may
be
sufﬁcient
to
buffer
calciﬁcation-induced
H
’
production
.
In
this
way
,
calciﬁcation
and
photosynthesis
may
proceed
independently
,
which
is
in
agreement
with
data
showing
that
calciﬁcation
may
be
inhibited
without
altering
photosynthesis
[
1,96
]
.
In
the
dark
,
acidiﬁcation
of
the
coelenteric
cavity
caused
by
increased
CO2
together
with
low
02
tension
[
42
]
and
reduced
ATP
,
causes
inhibition
of
calciﬁcation
.
In
the
light
,
high
O2
tension
increases
the
respiratory
rate
and
thus
CO2
production

for

and

,
in

with
high
pH
within
the

,
which

to

.
Another
hypothesis
has
been
recently
suggested
by
the
group
of
J
.
-
P.
Cuif
[
20,38
]
.
By
analysing
the
composition
in
amino
acids
of
OM
from
13
symbiotic
and
11
non-symbiotic
corals
,
they
showed
that
this
composition
is
dependent
upon
the
presence
of
symbionts
.
If
aspartic
acid
remains
the
major
amino
acid
in
both
groups
of
corals
,
the
amount
of
glutamic
acid
is
always
higher
in
symbiotic
vs.
non-symbiotic
corals
.
Similarly
,
threonine
is
high
in
symbiotic
corals
and
low
in
non-symbiotic
ones
,
while
the
opposite
is
observed
for
threonine
.
OM
content
of
sugars
(
mannose
,
galactose
,
galactosamine
,
glucosamine
)
is
also
signiﬁcantly
different
in
the
two
groups
of
corals
.
All
these
results
suggest
that
symbionts
may
affect
OM
precursor
synthesis
,
or
may
provide
these
precursors
.
This
hypothesis
is
not
exclusive
with
that
of
DIC
equilibrium
.

Environmental
control
of
coral
calciﬁcation
One
goal
of
coral-reef
ecologists
is
to
predict
the
effects
of
environmental
conditions
(
natural
or
anthropogenic
)
on
the
integrity
of
scleractinian
coral
communities
.
It
is
now
well
established
that
a
change
in
most
of
the
environmental
parameters
such
as
light
,
temperature
,
CO2
partial
pressure
(
pcoﬂ
)
and
nutrients

rectly
affects
coral
growth
rates
and
thus
coral
calciﬁcation
.
It
has
become
patently
clear
that
coral
reefs
around
the
world
are
coming
under
increasing
pressures
and
their
status
is
declining
rapidly
[
92
]
.
One
prominent
example
of
stress
is
the
increased
frequency
of
mass
coral
bleaching
events
(
loss
of
chlorophyll
,
zooxanthellae
and
reduced
calciﬁcation
)
since
the
early
1980s
[
43
]
.
Corals
are
subject
to
stresses
at
the
local
,
regional
,
and
global
scales
.
At
the
local
and
regional
scale
,
reefs
deteriorate
in
all
areas
where
human
activities
are
concentrated
,
due
to
an
increase
in
seawater
pollution
(
heavy
metals
,
eutrophication
,
bacterial
and
viral
diseases
)
,
and
human
pressures
(
diving
,
ﬁshing
,
tourism
...
)
.
In
addition
to
these
stresses
,
corals
also
experience
the
effect
of
the
‘
global
change
’
[
45
]
,
i.e.
Increased
seawater
temperature
,
ultra-violet
radiations
,
and
pcoz
as
well
as
increased
sediment
loading
.
Therefore
,
major
actions
were
undertaken
to
better
understand
the
effects
of
a
change
in
the
main
environmental
parameters
on
the
survival
of
reef
corals
,
and
especially
the
effects
on
their
rates
of
calciﬁcation
.
Effects
of
eutrophication
,
of
increased
pcoﬂ
levels
and
seawater
temperature
on
coral
calciﬁcation
have
attracted
scientists
’
attention
.
Eutrophication
corresponds
to
an
increase
in
nutrient
concentrations
,
in
sediment
load
and
in
a
development
of
algae
[
50
]
,
all
of
them
reducing
light
available
to
the
corals
and
necessary
for
their
calciﬁcation
.
Laboratory
and
in
situ
experiments
have
also
reported
a
decrease
in
calciﬁcation
under
nutrient-enriched
conditions
.
At
the
community
level
,
Kinsey
and
Davies
[
49
]
measured
a
pronounced
decrease
(
50
%
)
in
the
overall
calciﬁcation
following
an
8-month
fertilization
period
of
a
patch
reef
system
in
the
Great
Barrier
Reef
.
Tomascik
[
86
]
and
Tomascik
and
Sanders
[
87
]
found
a
correlation
between
anthropogenic
disturbances
and
decreased
skeletal
growth
in
the
coral
Montastraea
annularis
.
At
the
organism
level
,
several
studies
have
monitored
a
lower
calciﬁcation
under
different
enrichments
in
ammonium
,
nitrate
,
and
phosphorus
[
28,29,55,82
]
,
up
to
50
%
.
An
iron
enrichment
,
often
seen
during
El
Niﬁo
periods
,
also
decreases
by
20
%
the
growth
of
scleractinian
corals
[
29
]
.
The
way
by
which
nutrients
interact
with
calciﬁcation
is
still
poorly
known
.
They
generally
highly
enhance
the
growth
of
the
algal
component
,
and
this
might
lead
to
a
disruption
of
the
symbiosis
,
and
especially
the
coupling
between
photosynthesis
and
calciﬁcation
.
Calciﬁcation
is
also
affected
by
an
increase
in
the
pcoﬂ
,
which
has
risen
from
280
to
370
patm
since
the
last
-
century
,
as
a
result
of
human
activities
and
could
reach
705
uatm
in
year
2100
[
45
]
.
An
increase
in
seawater
pcoz
induces
a
change
in
the
other
carbon
components
such
as
bicarbonate
(
HCO3
’
)
and
carbonate
(
CO32
’
)
and
corresponds
to
a
decrease
in
C032
’
.
Coral
calciﬁcation
seems
however
intimately
linked
to
the
calcium-carbonate
saturation
state
(
cu
)
,
which
is
the
ratio
of
the
ion
concentration
product
(
[
Ca2
+
]
X
[
CO32
’
]
)
to
the
solubility
product
of
the
mineral
deposited
.
Therefore
,
a
decrease
in
the
concentration
of
C032
’
in
seawater
has
been
related
to
a
sha1p
decrease
in
coral
calciﬁcation
,
at
the
organism
or
community
level
[
37,5
l
,53,56
]
.
Together
with
the
change
in
pcoﬂ
,
the
global
warming
also
corresponds
to
an
increase
in
the
mean
sea
surface
temperature
,
which
is
expected
to
rise
by
l
—
3
°
C
over
the
coming
century
[
68
]
.
This
is
leading
to
the
frequent
El
Niﬁo
events
[
93
]
.
The
bleaching
and
death
of
the
coral
colonies
after
an
El
Niﬁo
event
is
generally
followed
by
a
strong
coral
bioerosion
,
reducing
the
3-D
reef
structure
[
43
]
.
When
both
higher
level
of
pcoz
and
temperatures
are
combined
,
coral
calciﬁcation
is
lowered
by
50
%
[
73
]
.
In
conclusion
,
coral
reef
ecosystems
are
under
the
threats
of
local
direct
anthropogenic
stresses
,
and
of
the
more
extended
stresses
of
global
change
,
which
include
,
in
addition
to
a
raise
in
temperature
and
pcoﬂ
,
an
elevation
of
the
sea
level
and
in
the
ultraviolet
radiations
.

There

Anticipation
of
future
environmental
and
climatic
change
depends
upon
knowing
and
,
hopefully
,
understanding
what
has
happened
in
the
past
and
is
now
happening
.
However
,
instrumental
records
of
weather
and
climate
go
back
only
about
several
centuries
and
that
time
span
is
insufﬁcient
to
judge
whether
recently
observed
rises
in
global
temperature
are
normal
or
not
.
Corals
can
provide
climate
and
environmental
records
for
the

’s
shallow-water

regions
,
since
these
areas
are
poorly

by

proxies
(

,

,

)
.
Moreover

massive
species
can
provide
information
both
for
the
last
several
centuries
(
from
living
corals
)
and
for
welldated
windows
of
the
more
distant
past
(
from
wellpreserved
dead
and
fossil
corals
)
.
Corals
build
their
skeletons
from
calcium
and
carbonate
extracted
from
seawater
,
so
their
skeleton
contains
isotopes
of
oxygen
,
carbon
,
as
well
as
trace
metals
(
Sr
,
Mg
,
U
,
Th
...
)
.
Thus
,
proxy
climate
and
environmental
information
are
stored
in
coral
skeletons
as
growth
characteristics
(
e.g.
,
skeletal
extension
,
density
and
calciﬁcation
)
.
Examples
of
information
stored
in
coral
skeletons
include
sea-surface
temperatures
(
SSTs
)
,
river
ﬂow
,
rainfall
,
upwelling
,
salinity
and
anthropogenic
inﬂuences
.
The
great
majority
of
corals
used
for
palaeoreconstructions
are
massive
genus
(
as
Porites
or
Diploastrea
)
.
Corals
are
drilled
and
the
sampling
skeleton
is
cut
in
order
to
obtain
a
slice
(
1
cm
width
)
.
Coral
skeleton
is
characterized
by
annual
density
bands
visible
on
X-ray
radiographies
(
Fig.
4
)
.
The
sum
of
a
dark
(
high-density
)
and
a
light
(
low-density
)
band
represents
one
year
[
7
]
.
This
characteristic
provides
a
built-in
chronometer
that
enables
ﬁrst-order
dating
as
well
as
identiﬁcation
of
particular
years
and
speciﬁc
seasons
.
Once
years
are
located
,
very
small
samples
of
skeleton
are
taken
on
a
line
along
the
coral
growth
axis
,
and
isotopic
composition
of
oxygen
(
5180
)
and
carbon
(
513C
)
are
analysed
with
a
mass
spectrometer
.
The
skeletal
5180
varies
with
temperature
and
salinity
of
the
water
where
the
coral
grew
in
.
The
isotopic
composition
is
expressed

which
is

However
,
the
promise
of
coral
density
bands
to
yield
similar
fabulous
records
to
those
obtained
from
tree
rings
has
not
been
yet
realized
despite
extensive
works
.
One
problem
is
that
such
proxies
need
to
be
calibrated
before
their
use
.
The
great
majority
of
calibrations
have
been
carried
out
in
the
ﬁeld
(
see
for
example
[
17,89
]
)
;
however
,
calibrations
carried
out
in
the
laboratory
under
controlled
conditions
seem
necessary
to
decipher
the
effect
of
each
environmental
parameter
(
temperature
,
salinity
,
light
...
)
.
Such
an
approach
has
been
used
successfully
with
foraminifera
(
e.g.
,
[
8l
]
)
but
difﬁculties
encountered
with
culture
techniques
have
precluded
the
development
of
experimental
calibrations
of
proxy
records
in
corals
.
However
,
recently
several
works
have
been
done
concerning
the
effects
of
several
parameters
(
temperature
,
light
,
nutrition
,
pcoz
)
on
coral
isotopic
composition
[
70
—
72
]
.
Recently
,
it
has
been
shown
that
isotopic
record
is
profoundly
inﬂuenced
by
biology
(
so-called
‘
Vital
Effect
’
)
:
different
coral
colonies
cultured
in
the
laboratory
under
exactly
the
same
temperature
conditions
have
yielded
5180
measurements
that
present
a
huge
variability
(
2
%
o
)
(
Fig.

,
Stylophora
pistillata
)
.
However
,
when
5180
measurements
are
done
on
nubbins
from
the
same
parent
colony
,
there
is
no
such
variability
(
Fig.
5
,
Acropora
sp
.
)
.
This
suggests
that
a
calibration
curve
is
speciﬁc
for
each
colony
considered
.
We
thus
concluded
that
the
5180
recorded
in
coral
skeleton
is
affected
not
only
by
temperature
and
salinity
of
the
seawater
,
but
also
by
the
biological
activity
.

Conclusions
This
review
highlights
the
complexity
,
but
also
the
weakness
of
our
knowledge
concerning
biomineralisation
mechanisms
in
corals
.
Formation
of
a
coral
skeleton
is
the
result
of
complex
,
biologically
regulated
phenomenon
,
largely
unknown
.
Due
to
the
fact
that
coral
reefs
are
presently
disturbed
by
human
activities
,
it
is
urgent
to
develop
research
on
coral
biology
,
associating
physiologists
,
molecular
and
genome
biologists
,
geneticists
,
ecologists
...
Beyond
the
beneﬁt
for
our
environment
,
a
better
knowledge
of
coral
calciﬁcation
will
help
to
understand
biomineralisation
mechanisms
by
themselves
,
which
remain
poorly
understood
,
even
in
mammals
:
“
Bone
physiology
is
undoubtedly
the
source
of
many
concepts
of
biomineralization
,
but
it
remains
as
one
of
the
few
physiological
processes
for
which
there
is
a
uniﬁed
theory
and
one
of
the
few
medical
interests
that
have
not
beneﬁted
from
comparative
studies
