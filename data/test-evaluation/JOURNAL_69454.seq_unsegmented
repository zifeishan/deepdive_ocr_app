Climatically controlled Late Quaternary terrace staircase development in the fold- and -thrust belt of the Sub Himalaya Abstract The alluviation and incision history of Late Quaternary terrace staircases of Yamuna River and its tributaries in the Sub Himalaya, between the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), were studied to understand interlinkages between tectonics and climate in their genesis. We documented five levels of terraces (T1 to T5), cutting across numerous tectonic plains, ranging in elevation from 65–80, 40–44, 28–30, 8–12 and 3–4 m from the present day river bed, deposited by both glacier-fed perennial and piedmont-fed ephemeral streams. Temporal and spatial distribution of these terraces, coupled with absolute ages based on optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology documents five distinct fluvial accretions separated by incision events spanning between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and MIS 1. Two major accretion phases occur in the Late Pleistocene (> 37 to 24 ka and > 15 to 11 ka) and three minor phases in the mid- to late Holocene (7–4 ka; 3–2 ka; and < 2 ka). The Phase-I aggradation is thicker and occurs as alluvial fill in a pre-existing valley, whereas younger accretion sequences are cut-in-fill and rest over remnant deposits. The periods of terrace formation are coeval with the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) oscillations, however abrupt termination of T1 to T3 terraces in the Himalayan mountain front reflects tectonic upheaval along HFT after their development. This study outlines the climatic control on the terrace genesis in the tectonically active Himalaya on the scale of 10 3 –10 4 years. Highlights ► The terraces genesis in the tectonically active Sub-Himalaya is controlled by climate change. ► The frequency and extends of aggradation and incision phases are influence by Late Pleistocene-Holocene Indian Summer Monsoon fluctuations. ► The tectonic uplift along HFT amplified vertical incision before 3 ka.

Introduction The Late Pleistocene–Holocene river terraces and their genesis are generally correlated either with climate, resulting in sediment supply and/or water discharge ( Hancock and Anderson, 2002 , Bridgland and Westaway, 2008 and Vandenberghe, 2008 ) or with tectonic deformation ( Láve and Avouac, 2000 and Hodges et al., 2004 ). In any tectonically active mountain belt, the relative role of climate perturbations in terrace formation generates interests amongst geoscientists ( Starkel, 2003 and Bridgland and Westaway, 2008 ; and references therein). In the orogenic belt of the Himalaya, the studies of Pleistocene–Holocene fluvial deposits have addressed a close relationship between uplift, climatic variations (orographic control on monsoon intensification) and erosion ( Láve and Avouac, 2000 , Bookhagen et al., 2005 , Wobus et al., 2005 , Suresh et al., 2007 , Srivastava et al., 2008 and Sinha et al., 2010 ). This time interval is also well known for the dynamics of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), resulting purterbations in the Himalayan rivers ( Goodbred, 2003 , Thiede et al., 2004 and Gibling et al., 2005 ) and glacial maxima ( Owen, 2009 ). The response of climate and tectonics might be manifested in the duration of alluviation and incision phenomena of fluvial deposits in the thust bounded Sub Himalaya. The Sub Himalaya archives a good repository of alluvial fans and fluvial terraces, mainly deposited in the duns (e.g. Dehra Dun, Pinjaur Dun, Soan Dun) over the last 100 ka, by glacial-fed major rivers (e.g. Satluj, Yamuna and Ganga) and their tributaries ( Nakata, 1972 , Khan and Dubey, 1981 , Singh et al., 2001 , Kumar et al., 2007 , Suresh et al., 2007 and Sinha et al., 2010 ). At places, these deposits have undergone neo-tectonic deformation ( Nakata, 1972 , Oatney et al., 2001 , Virdi and Philip, 2006 , Thakur et al., 2007 , Philip et al., 2009 and Jayangondaperumal et al., 2010 ). The present study aims to understand the intricacy of climate in the tectonically active mountain range of the Sub Himalaya, using geomorphologic features, sedimentologic proxies and well constrained optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) based chronology, and their role in the evolution of terraces along the Yamuna River and its tributaries ( Fig. 1 A and B). Previous studies in this area have supported two contrasting views for the genesis of terraces, either related to tectonic activity ( Singh et al., 2001 ) or climatic amelioration ( Khan and Dubey, 1981 ). However, these studies have lacked well constrained chronology of valley aggradation and incision. This paper deals with detailed mapping of terraces along with sound chronology for alluviation and incision and discusses how climatic and tectonic variability have affected the genesis of terraces. 2. Study area: geology, structure and drainage system The study area, located in the western part of Doon Valley (Dehra Dun), a piggy-back basin in the Sub Himalaya ( Fig. 1 B), is bordered by the Lesser Himalayan rocks (argillite, limestone and siliciclastics rocks of Proterozoic age) in the north along the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and the Indo-Ganga Plain (IGP; Quaternary alluvial deposits) in the south, along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT). The Sub Himalaya consists of Subathus (marine shale and sandstone deposits of Late Paleocene to Middle Eocene age), Siwaliks (fluvial conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone deposits of Miocene to Pleistocene age) and post-Siwalik sediments (gravel, sand and mud of Late Quaternary). The Subathu Group is exposed between MBT and Main Boundary Fault (MBF). The Siwalik rocks ( Fig. 1 B) are exposed as dissected (e.g. Santaugarh anticline; ~ 900 m above mean sea level (amsl)) and detached Siwalik hills (Mohand anticline and Kaleshwar syncline; ~ 750 m to 450 m amsl) which is separated by a synclinal depression of Doon Valley (~ 600 to 400 m amsl). The northern part of the Sub Himalaya exhibits a series of imbricate thrusts of MBT ( Raiverman, 2002 ) such as MBF, Santaugarh Thrust (ST) and Bhauwala Thrust (BWT). The detached Siwalik Hills are dislocated along Yamuna Tear Fault (YTF), an N–S trending tear fault. The Yamuna, a perennial river, originates from the glacier covered Higher Himalaya, drains through the Lesser and Sub Himalaya into Ganga Plain cutting across major tectonic lines such as the Main Central Thrust (MCT), MBT and HFT ( Fig. 1 A). The Yamuna River is further joined by the glacial-fed Tons and Amlava rivers and piedmont-fed ephemeral streams/rivers (like the Bin, Naro, Asan, Giri and Bata), which carry significant discharge during the southwest (SW) Monsoon ( Fig. 1 B). The Yamuna River has narrow active channel width (about 30 to 40 m) in the confined gorge regions in the Lesser Himalaya. In the Sub Himalaya, the width is narrow between MBT and BWT (~ 250 m) and detached (~ 400 m) Siwalik hills, however, in between, width of the channel-belt increases to several kilometers with active channel of 300–500 m. 3. Materials and methods The temporal and spatial distribution of terrace staircases, both fluvial and alluvial fan, was mapped for an ~ 40 km stretch between MBT and HFT and elevation of terraces from present day river bed were documented using Total Station. The river profile is constructed using Survey of India toposheet (1:50,000 scale) at 20 m contour interval and trends of terraces are plotted in the river profile ( Fig. 2 ). The stratigraphy and sedimentology were established through vertical logs, constructed on exposed sections along the Yamuna River and its tributaries. The chrono-stratigraphy of terraces was established by OSL dating techniques of 25 samples, fine- to medium-grained sand collected in metallic pipes, carried out at the Luminescence Dating Laboratory of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehra Dun. In the laboratory, samples unexposed to light were treated for removing carbonate and organic matter using 1 N HCl and 30% H 2 O 2 respectively, and sieved to obtain 90–125 μm size fraction. The quartz grains were extracted by density separation using sodium polytungstate solution and were etched for 80 min in hydrofluoric acid to remove the outer layer (this process also removes any feldspar contaminations) and subsequently treated with HCl and re-sieved. The purity of the etched quartz (i.e. any feldspar contaminations) is carried out by infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) technique. The etched quartz grains were fixed on stainless steel discs (i.e., about 3 mm diameter mono layer of samples in 10 mm diameter steel discs) using silicon oil for determining the radiation energy received by the sample after its burial (i.e. palaeo dose or equivalent dose (De). The Single Aliquot Regeneration protocol ( Murray and Wintle, 2000 ) was used for De determination. The OSL measurements were carried out, using 240 °C pre-heat, 160 °C cut heat, laboratory irradiation from a calibrated beta source (Sr/Yr 90 ) and 40 s blue light stimulation, in an automated Riso TL/DA 20 reader equipped with blue light emitting diodes. The De values were calculated using the initial integral (0.8 s) of the OSL by Duller's Annalyse software. For the annual dose rate estimation, concentrations of uranium, thorium and potassium in the sediments were measured by XRF and water content was determined by heating at 100 °C. 4. Results 4.1. Geomorphology: distribution of terraces The fluvial terraces and alluvial fans are prominent geomorphic features in the Yamuna Valley. The alluvial fans are deposited by the tributaries (e.g. Amlava, Tons, Giri, Bin and Naro) forming a series of fan terraces having similar elevation as fluvial terraces and their toes are terminated by the Yamuna River. Based on structural and geomorphic settings, the study area is divided into three zones ( Fig. 1 B). In Zones 1and 3 the Siwalik bedrock is exposed whereas Zone 2 falls along the Dehra Dun piggy-back basin. Five levels of terraces, fill, cut-in-fill or resting over former valley wall of the Siwalik rocks were identified and labeled as T1 (oldest and highest) to T5 (youngest and lowest) and correlated laterally on their relative elevation and chronology ( Table 1 ; Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 ). 4.1.1. Zone 1 Five levels of fluvial and fan terraces (T1 to T5) were documented from four locations at Bhosan, Katapathar, Asharori, and Kalsi villages ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 ). At Bhosan Village area, on the right bank of Yamuna River, T1, T2, T4 and T5 fluvial terraces occur at 76, 44, 12 and 3 m elevations respectively with T1 and T2 are resting on the former valley wall of the Siwalik rocks whereas T4 and T5 are fill terraces ( Fig. 3 A). On the opposite bank, similar terraces occur at 80, 38, 11 and 3 m elevation respectively and all are resting over former valley wall of the Siwalik rock. However, about 1000 m downstream, near Katapathar, all the five levels of terraces are observed, resting over former valley wall of the Siwalik rock with T3 surface at 28 m elevation ( Fig. 3 B). At Asharori, five levels of terraces (T1 to T5) are mapped at 80, 40, 28, 12 and 3 m elevations respectively ( Fig. 3 C). T1 represents an alluvial fan surface (Naro Fan) which exhibits a continuous fill of about 80 m from the Naro Nadi ( Fig. 3 C). The Naro Fan is dissected by the Naro Nadi, forming four (T2 to T5) paired cut-in-fill terraces resting over fan remnant. Further downstream, at Barwala, T3 surface is exposed at 28 m elevation ( Fig. 3 D), resting over fan remnant. At Kalsi, four levels (T2–T5) of terraces are documented at 40, 28, 13 and 4 m elevations above Yamuna River bed ( Fig. 3 E), of which T2 is a fan terrace formed by Amlava–Tons rivers and others are cut-in-fill terraces. 4.1.2. Zone 2 Four levels of terraces, T2 toT5, are mapped at four locations, namely Vikasnagar, Rampur Mandi, Haripur and Fatehpur. T2 is fill fan terrace and T3 is a cut-in-fill terrace resting over a fan remnant whereas others are fill-terraces. These terraces are continuing from Zone 1 and cutting across the Bhauwala Thrust. At Vikasnagar (near Mehuwala), T2 to T5 terraces are well developed along the Yamuna River and occur at 42, 28, 12 and 3 m elevations respectively ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 ). Further downstream, at Rampur Mandi area, only three levels of terraces, T3 to T5 are observed at 28, 8 and 3 m elevations respectively ( Fig. 4 B) whereas on the opposite bank, at Haripur, four levels of terraces (T2 to T5) at 42, 28, 10 and 3 m are developed ( Fig. 4 C). At Fatehpur, only T4 surface is observed at 12 m elevation on the right bank of Asan River ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 D). 4.1.3. Zone 3 Five levels of terraces (T1 to T5) are documented from this zone and all the terraces are resting over former valley wall of the Siwalik rocks ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 ). Near Paonta Sahib, T2 to T5 surfaces are mapped at 40, 30, 10 and 3 m elevation respectively on the right bank of Yamuna River whereas on the opposite bank, only T3 surface, at 28 m elevation, is observed ( Fig. 5 A). On the right bank of the Bata River, T3 surface occurs at 28 m elevation resting over the Siwalik rocks and is very extensive ( Fig. 5 B). The interfluve surface of the Bata and the Yamuna River, occur about 12 m below the surrounding T3 surface. Further downstream, at Bahral ( Fig. 1 B), T1 to T5 surfaces are occurring at 65, 40, 28, 10 and 3 m elevations ( Fig. 5 B and C) of which T2 is observed on both banks of Yamuna River. T1 to T3 terraces are abruptly terminated along the HFT whereas T4 and T5 continue across the HFT. 4.2. Sedimentology Sedimentological analysis of mapped sections shows seven distinct depositional facies ( Table 2 ). Facies Gm, St, Sm, and Fm are common and observed in all three zones whereas Gdm and Ghm are observed only in Zone 1. The Gm ( Fig. 6 A and B) consists of rounded to well rounded boulder to pebble size clasts, dominantly of quartzite with minor phyllite, basic rocks and granite, derived from the Lesser and Higher Himalaya. The Gdm ( Fig. 6 C) consists of subrounded to rounded boulder to pebble size clasts of quartzite, sandstone and phyllite, derived from Siwalik conglomerate and the Lesser Himalayan rocks whereas Ghm ( Fig. 6 D) consists of angular cobble to pebble size clasts of phyllite derived from the Lesser Himalayan succession exposed in the vicinity of MBT. The facies St is coarse to fine grained and rests commonly over Gm with a gradational contact or in the form of lensoid body (30 to 80 cm thick) within Gm. The facies Sm is fine grained and is associated with facies Gdm. The Mud facies, Fm and Fs, are silt to clay grade; Fm is much more common whereas Fs is observed locally. The T1 is represented by both fluvial and alluvial fan deposits in Zone 1, but by only fluvial deposits in Zone 3. T1 fluvial succession in Zone 1 is 13 m thick and consists of 5.1 m thick Gm overlain by St and capped by Gdm facies, but at places it shows interfingering with Ghm and Gdm facies ( Fig. 3 A). At Bahral in Zone 3, it is 15 m thick and consists of Fm, Fs and Sm facies with minor Gm and St facies. On the other hand, alluvial fan sequence in Zone 1 (Naro Fan) is 80 m thick, consisting of Gdm and overlain by Gm facies with minor lensoid St/Sm facies ( Fig. 3 C). T2 to T5 terraces in all the zones comprises dominantly Gm facies with thickness varying from 3 to 30 m ( Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 and 6A &amp; B). However, T4 surface at Fatehpur rests over brownish-grey paleosol of remnant fan ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 D). 4.3. Chronostratigraphy Luminescence dating was carried out for 25 samples to constrain the phases of alluviation and incision and the results are summarized in Table 3 and Fig. 3 , Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 . 4.3.1. Zone 1 In Bhosan Village area, an OSL sample obtained from T1 terrace on the left bank of the Yamuna River provided an age of 25.0 ± 2.3 ka (LD-227; Fig. 3 A). On the opposite bank, the oldest age obtained 2.4 m below T1 surface, is 26.4 ± 1 ka (LD-226) whereas an age obtained at 4.2 m below T2 surface is 25.9 ± 3.4 ka (LD-225). The youngest age obtained from 2 m below T4 surface is 2.1 ± 0.4 ka (LD-224). At Katapathar, an OSL age obtained from 6 m below the T3 surface is 5.56 ± 0.74 ka (LD-513). At Asharori, the two OSL samples obtained from the bottom and top of the Naro Fan, representing the T1 terrace, give an older age of 37.08 ± 2.78 ka (LD-512; 13 m above the Naro Nadi bed) and an younger age of 24.7 ± 1.9 ka (LD-511; 3 m below the top surface, Fig. 3 C). On the left bank of Naro Nadi, OSL age obtained from 13 m below T2 and 21 m below T3 surface of Naro Fan gives age of 15.33 ± 0.07 ka (LD-675) and 29.96 ± 1.67 ka (LD-514) respectively. Similarly, the OSL samples obtained from the Tons-Amlava fan, 23 m below the T3 surface give an age of 26.64 ± 2.66 ka (LD-515) and 6 m below T4 gives an age of 26.2 + 1.87 ka (LD-516; Fig. 3 E). This suggests that T3 and T4 terraces are resting over fan remnant on both banks of the Yamuna River. Further down stream, at Barwala ( Fig. 3 D), OSL age from 60 cm below top of T3 is 6.84 ± 1.32 ka (LD-676). 4.3.2. Zone 2 In the Vikasnagar area, an OSL sample from sand bed at the top of the fan sequence at Mehuwala village, from 30 cm below T2 surface gives an age of 12.5 ± 1.4 ka (LD 588; Fig. 4 A). In the Rampur Mandi area, a sample from 80 cm below the T4 surface on the left bank of the Yamuna River ( Fig. 4 B) gives an age of 2.4 ± 0.1 ka (LD-692). At Fatehpur ( Fig. 4 D), two samples from top of T4 gives ages of 3.03 ± 0.29 ka (LD-690) and 2.04 ± 0.22 ka (LD-587) whereas one sample obtained from the fan remnant gives an age of 25.99 ± 2.18 ka (LD586). 4.3.3. Zone 3 At Paonta Sahib, an OSL sample from a sandy bed from 2.5 m below the T3 surface, on the left bank of Yamuna River, gives an age of 5.18 ± 0.18 ka (LD-688; Fig. 5 A). Two OSL samples from the right bank of Bata River at 9 m and 50 cm below from T3 surface ( Fig. 5 B), give age of 4.94 ± 1.14 ka (LD-591) and 4.05 ± 0.17 ka (LD-693) respectively. On the opposite bank, two ages were obtained at 1.5 and 1 m below interfluve surface ( Fig. 5 B), provided ages of 13.8 ± 1.82 ka (LD-592) and 19.88 ± 1.85 ka (LD-687) respectively. These OSL ages indicate that this sedimentary pile is time equivalent to T2 sequence elsewhere. However, its lower elevation from the adjoining T3 surface suggests that about 12 m of younger succession of interfluve might has been removed during the incision phase between T3 and T4 due to lateral migration of rivers. Two OSL samples obtained from bottom and top of T1 and one from 2 m below T2 surface, at Bahral, give age of 26.5 ± 2.4 ka (LD-425), 25.2 ± 1.8 ka (LD-424) and 20.15 ± 1.51 ka (LD-689) respectively ( Fig. 5 C). 5. Discussion 5.1. Depositional environment The facies and their distribution coupled with nature and material composition represent depositional variability of the fluvial and fan terraces in the Yamuna Valley. These facies are grouped into three distinct facies association (FA): FA-I consist of Gm, St, Sm facies and rare occurrences of Fm and Fs with clasts belonging to the Higher and the Lesser Himalaya and paleoflow direction parallel to the modern Yamuna River. FA-II comprises Gdm, Gm, St and minor Fm having Lesser and Sub Himalayan clasts with paleoflow parallel to tributary streams thereby suggesting their deposition by local streams forming alluvial fan. These deposits differ from those of the Yamuna River in sorting, clast composition, matrix type and paleoflow direction. FA-III consists of only Ghm facies, which was deposited on the hill slope and is restricted to T1 and T2 surfaces at Bhosan village (Zone-1) where intermittent slope failure in the form of landslide is associated within the Yamuna River deposit that led to interfingering of fluvial and colluvium in terrace deposits. In Zone 1, all the three FAs are present, however, FA-II is dominant in alluvial fan sequences whereas fluvial terrace deposits have FA-I with local interfingering of FA-III. This interfingering suggests that locally derived debris flow or creep events were separated by aggradation phases of the Yamuna River. In Zones 2 and 3, FA-I is dominant and represents Yamuna deposits. The 40 km stretch of the studied area from Zone 1 to 3, FA-I shows reduction of clast size and thickness of Gm with increase in thickness of St and Fm facies. This suggests that deposition took place by sand-laden stream flow in stable environment. Sedimentological attributes suggest that the Yamuna River deposits show downstream fining mainly due to hydraulic sorting. Thick aggradation (80 m) of T1, deposited by piedmont-fed stream suggests that local deposition by tributaries dominated over Yamuna deposition during this time. 5.2. Aggradation and Incision History Well constrained OSL ages of the Yamuna Valley show five clusters of alluviation indicating five phases of aggradation since 37 ka with the oldest at higher and the youngest at lower elevations, separated by intermittent incision phases ( Fig. 7 ). In the Late Pleistocene, two phases of aggradation, represented by T1 and T2 terraces are recorded. Phase I was initiated before 37 ka and ceased after 24 ka. The initiation of Phase II aggradation could not be constrained due to lack of any datable material at the base of the sections. However, it was certainly initiated before ~ 15 ka (LD-675) and continued till 12 ka (LD-588). Phase I accumulation continued for a long duration with thick sediment accretion and occurs as alluvial fan (FA-II) in a pre-existing valley or as valley margin fill (FA-I) resting over the bed rock. The observed dissimilarity in sediment accretion of Yamuna River (~ 20 m thick) and its tributaries (~ 80 m thick; Fig. 3 C) is noteworthy. The older sequence in the tributaries indicates accommodation and preservation space was available since 37 ka in the valley. The absence of time equivalent sediment in the Yamuna River, especially in the confined regime (Zones 1 and 3), suggests their erosion during the subsequent incision phase. Phase II sequences are cut-in-fill, resting over Phase I and are dominated by FA-I. The two Pleistocene aggradation phases were punctuated by incision phases at ~ 24 ka and ~ 11 ka. On the other hand, the three Holocene aggradation phases recorded between 7 and 4 ka (Phase III); 3 and 2 ka (Phase IV) and younger than 2 ka (Phase V) were of shorter duration ( Fig. 7 ). Among these, Phase III accretion was thick (~ 12 m) and extensive whereas the subsequent phases were thin. These Holocene events were dominated by FA-I and deposited by both glacial and non-glacial fed rivers. The aggradation phases were separated by incision phases between 11 and 7 ka, 4 and 3 ka and less than 2 ka. 5.3. Causes for aggradation and incision: role of climate and tectonics The Quaternary terraces resulting from aggradation and incision phases are reported globally and are correlated either with tectonic deformation or climatic changes. The Late Pleistocene–Holocene terraces of the Yamuna Valley are paired fills resting on the bedrock along valley margin and cut-in-fill with similar distribution across tectonic zones indicate that their origin is not related to tectonically induced base level change. Moreover, clast size distribution of gravels on the terraces does not show any systematic change with terrace position other than downstream hydraulic sorting. Even though these terraces cut across various discontinuities within the Sub Himalaya, no noticeable break in slope along the downstream direction is observed ( Fig. 2 ). The absence of warping, tilting and dislocation suggest that they remained unaffected by hinterland tectonic activity after their formatiom. However, abrupt termination of T1 to T3 at the mountain front and decrease in valley width with staircase of terraces (T1 to T5) suggests tectonic uplift along the HFT which may have amplified incision. On the other hand, age data indicate that the abandonment of these terraces occurred during major climatic fluctuations in the Late Pleistocene–Holocene glacial–interglacial oscillations and related arid–humid (or vice versa) transitions. Both these climatic conditions can control the water:sediment ratio and availability of soil and regolith for erosion. The Phase I aggradation during MIS 3 coincides with the glacial phase in major parts of the Himalaya between 60 and 30 ka ( Owen et al., 2008 ). Growth of the Himalayan glaciers during MIS 3 lowered snowline in response to moderately strong monsoon and cool temperature ( Finkel et al., 2003 and Owen et al., 2008 ). This suggests that the Phase I aggradation is due to the sparse vegetation and enhanced erosion in the catchments. Time equivalent aggradation events ( Fig. 8 ) are reported from various parts of duns in the Sub Himalaya ( Suresh et al., 2007 , Philip et al., 2009 and Suresh and Kumar, 2009 ) and IGP ( Srivastava et al., 2003 , Gibling et al., 2005 and Tandon et al., 2006 ) suggesting widespread and extensive aggradation controlled by climate. The termination of this event at around 24 ka corroborates with global LGM (19–23 ka chronozone level-1 or 24–18 ka chronozone level-2; Owen, 2009 ) which is marked by a weak ISM ( Prell and Kutzbach, 1987 ) and reduced sediment supply. The subsequent incision phase occurred during the intensified monsoon. The intensified monsoon phases (IMPs) are documented between 29 and 24 ka in the higher reaches of the Satluj Valley ( Bookhagen et al., 2005 ) and 28 and 22 ka from the Arabian Sea ( Thamban et al., 2002 ). This suggests that the incision occurred either immediately after ~ 24 ka or had a hiatus during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) followed by monsoon intensification under glacial–interglacial transition. The Phase II aggradation was initiated well before ~ 15 ka and ceased around 11 ka (~ 12.5 ka at Mehuwala Village, Vikasnagar ( Fig. 4 A) and ~ 10.7 ka at Vikasnagar ( Singh et al., 2001 ) forming T2 terrace in the valley which is observed in all the zones. The accretion of sediments suggests monsoon strengthening, even though fluctuating during post-LGM period, which caused dispersal of locked sediments in the catchments and its deposition in the downstream valley. Similar aggradation events ( Fig. 8 ) are also documented from various tectonic regimes of the Himalaya and the IGP ( Singh et al., 2001 , Gibling et al., 2005 , Sinha et al., 2005 , Srivastava et al., 2008 and Sinha et al., 2010 ). The termination and subsequent incision began after 11 ka, under increased ISM strength. The Pleistocene–Holocene transition is widely reported as drier to wetter climatic regimes in the Himalayan region together with enhancement of ISM during MIS 2 ( Prell and Kutzbach, 1987 and Chauhan, 2008 .). Increase in precipitation changes the water:sediment ratio which results in incision and also facilitates toe erosion of fan sequence. This incision phase ( Fig. 8 ) is widespread and reported from upper and lower reaches of the Ganga valley in the Himalayan region as well as the Ganga Plain ( Sinha et al., 2010 ). During the Holocene, a minor alluviation phase (~ 7–4 ka; 3–2 ka and younger than ~ 2 ka) suggests that environment was not conducive for extensive aggradation as compared to the Late Pleistocene. Absence of early Holocene aggradation can be related to higher precipitation under Holocene climatic amelioration with limited sediment supply. Among Holocene alluviation, mid Holocene aggradation phase (~ 7 to 4 ka) is prominent and coincides with increased aridity and glacier advancement in the Himalaya ( Owen, 2009 ) coupled with weakened monsoon ( Sirocko et al., 1993 , Overpeck et al., 1996 , Thamban et al., 2001 , Thamban et al., 2002 , Gupta et al., 2003 and Gupta et al., 2005 ). These minor aggradation–incision phases since mid-Holocene were coeval with ISM oscillations. Our results demonstrate that the terrace geneses in the Himalayan front are appreciably controlled by climate change and frequency and extent of aggradation and incision phases are related to Late Pleistocene–Holocene ISM fluctuations in the tectonically active Himalaya on the scale of 10 3 –10 4 ka. However, tectonic uplift along HFT probably amplified vertical incision before 3 ka. 6. Conclusions The Yamuna valley terraces in the Sub Himalaya show five aggradational phases initiated before 37 ka with two major phases in the Late Pleistocene and three minor phases in the Holocene. Based on a sound chronology and field investigations, we infer the following important conclusions: 1. The Yamuna Valley shows five clusters of alluviation with two phases in the Pleistocene and three in the Holocene. Phase I accumulation occurred in a pre-existing valley or as valley margin whereas Phase II are cut-in-fill, resting over Phase I. Among the Holocene aggradation, Phase III accretion was thick whereas the subsequent phases are thin. 2. These terraces cut across various thrusts but do not exhibit any dislocation and warping, indicating that the terrace development was not related to tectonic activity in the hinterland of piggy-back basin. However abrupt termination of older terraces across mountain front suggests the tectonic uplift along HFT amplified incision. 3. In the Himalayan front, the origin of staircase terraces is corelatable with climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene–Holocene. Acknowledgments We are grateful to Prof. A. K.
