I
was
a
junior
in
high
school
when
the
first
edition
of
Marsh
's
Dinosaurs
came
out
and
it
was
the
first
true
scientific
publication
to
join
my
collection
of
dinosaur
books
.
It
has
remained
a
major
resource
for
me
all
those
years
and
it
shows
:
the
covers
have
long
since
fallen
off
,
and
the
pages
are
dog-eared
and
stained
.
For
me
,
books
are
tools
to
be
used
?
written
in
,
marked
up
,
and
sadly
,
eventually
worn
out
.
Thus
,
it
was
with
delight
when
I
learned
that
Marsh
's
Dinosaurs
was
to
be
reprinted
.
The
book
has
two
new
parts
,
a
brief
Foreword
from
one
of
Ostrom
's
former
students
,
Peter
Dodson
,
and
a
longer
Historical
Update
on
the
collecting
of
dinosaurs
in
the
Como
Bluff
region
by
my
colleague
Cliff
Miles
.
The
Foreword
encapsulates
the
impact
Marsh
had
on
dinosaur
paleontology
to
this
day
and
the
continued
influence
of
the
lithographs
printed
in
Marsh
's
Dinosaurs
.
The
Historical
Update
is
an
important
summary
of
the
work
and
discoveries
made
in
the
past
two
decades
at
Como
Bluff
and
surrounding
areas
,
including
the
first
discovery
of
an
gastralia
set
for
Apatosaurus
by
the
Tate
Museum
of
Casper
College
,
and
a
nearly
complete
Camarasaurus
grandis
by
Western
Paleontological
Laboratories
.
The
original
text
by
Ostrom
and
McIntosh
recounting
the
discovery
and
excavation
of
dinosaurs
by
crews
working
for
O.
C.
Marsh
,
is
given
verbatim
.
There
is
no
attempt
to
update
the
information
based
more
current
work
,
such
as
Kohl
and
McIntosh
(
1997
)
,
so
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
this
book
is
a
reprint
,
not
a
second
edition
.
The
real
"
meat
"
of
the
book
is
,
of
course
,
the
150
lithographic
illustrations
of
sauropod
and
stegosaur
bones
.
Marsh
had
commissioned
these
and
other
illustrations
while
serving
as
the
Vertebrate
Paleontologist
for
the
U.S.
Geological
Survey
.
This
position
gave
him
access
to
a
considerable
amount
of
tax
payer
's
money
(
there
are
letters
in
the
Marsh
correspondence
archives
that
show
that
this
was
not
a
limitless
supply
)
.
Marsh
had
planned
about
six
monographs
when
the
lithographs
were
commissioned
,
of
which
the
Dinocerata
and
Odontornithes
were
completed
and
published
before
Marsh
's
death
.
Another
monograph
,
the
Ceratopsia
,
was
completed
after
his
death
by
John
Hatcher
and
Richard
Lull
,
and
the
T
itanotheres
was
completed
by
Henry
Osborn
.
Two
other
monographs
on
the
Sauropoda
and
Stegosauria
were
planned
but
never
completed
.
It
is
the
lithographs
for
these
monographs
that
Ostrom
and
McIntosh
published
.
The
original
illustrations
are
true
works
of
art
and
it
is
unfortunate
that
photographs
have
now
superceded
lithographs
in
scientific
papers
.
Most
of
the
bones
illustrated
are
in
multiple
views
,
including
both
the
proximal
and
distal
ends
of
limb
elements
.
Almost
all
of
the
bones
look
"
perfect
,
"
with
no
crushing
and
with
few
missing
parts
.
While
it
is
true
that
many
bones
do
look
much
like
the
illustrations
(
e.g.
,
tibia
of
Stego
-
saurus
duplex
)
,
not
all
do
.
As
Erwin
Barbour
(
1890
)
has
charged
,
some
bones
are
less
than
perfect
,
but
no
hint
of
the
imperfections
have
been
given
in
the
figures
(
dotted
lines
,
etc.
)
,
except
in
a
few
(
e.g.
,
Plate
32
)
.
An
example
of
a
perfect
bone
that
really
is
n't
,
is
a
sauropod
cervical
vertebra
shown
in
Plate
15
.
Barbour
shows
that
the
vertebra
was
not
as
complete
as
Marsh
had
illustrated
(
Barbour
,
1890
:
fi
g.
1
)
.
Still
,
we
may
forgive
Marsh
for
making
the
bones
look
more
than
perfect
,
after
all
Jim
Madsen
's
(
1976
)
Allosaurus
monograph
as
done
the
same
thing
.
Marsh
's
Dinosaur
as
a
reprint
suffers
from
the
usual
problem
of
reprinting
a
book
,
namely
the
illustrations
are
not
as
good
as
the
original
.
Most
of
the
shadows
are
so
dark
as
to
appear
black
in
some
cases
.
Although
this
n't
too
much
of
a
problem
for
many
of
the
bones
illustrated
,
it
is
for
the
skull
of
Diplodocus
where
details
in
the
shadows
are
practically
indiscernible
(
for
some
reason
the
skull
images
of
Stego
-
saurus
did
not
suffer
the
same
fate
)
.
I
do
not
understand
why
,
with
the
advances
in
digital
imagery
,
illustrations
in
any
reprinted
book
are
so
poor.
Marsh
's
Dinosaurs
is
a
close
,
but
not
exact
reproduction
of
the
original
.
The
frontispiece
illustration
is
now
black
and
white
,
rather
than
colored
.
Several
illustrations
that
were
large
foldouts
now
have
a
binding
seam
through
them
,
for
example
Figure
3
,
map
showing
the
location
of
quarries
at
Como
Bluff
and
Plate
32
,
sauropod
caudal
vertebra
.
So
,
should
you
buy
the
book
?
If
you
have
an
old
copy
of
Marsh
's
Dinosaurs
,
then
no
,
the
older
copy
is
better
.
But
if
you
are
unlucky
not
to
have
one
,
then
yes
,
it
will
make
a
good
addition
to
your
library
,
especially
if
you
are
working
on
sauropods
or
stegosaurs
.

Between

"
which
both
contain
species
that
variously
exhibit
unique
anatomical
specializations
or
demonstrate
conditions
that
presage
holotherians
.
Martin
's
monograph
focuses
on
Portuguese
representatives
of
one
family
(
Dryolestidae
)
of
the
eupantotheres
.
He
does
not
consider
the
"
Eupantotheria
"
as
a
formal
taxonomic
unit
,
but
instead
an
ill
-
defined
grade
of
extinct
,
non
-
tribosphenic
mammals
in
which
most
representatives
have
an
unbasined
,
singlecusped
heel
(
talonid
)
on
their
lower
molars
.
As
discussed
by
Martin
,
dryolestids
are
the
most
diverse
and
longestlived
known
group
of
pre
-
tribosphenic
holotherians
.
Also
,
in
terms
of
diversity
and
abundance
as
fossils
,
dryolestids
were
the
dominant
holotherians
during
the
Late
Jurassic
and
Early
Cretaceous
.
Although
not
directly
ancestral
,
dryolestids
are
closely
related
to
tribosphenids
(
=
Aegialodontia
plus
Theria
)
.
Tribosphenids
primitively
have
a
strongly
developed
protocone
that
occludes
into
a
definitely
basined
talonid
on
the
lower
molars
.
Dryolestids
are
considered
the
sister
-
group
of
Peramus
and
its
allies
plus
Tribosphenida
,
and
thus
were
close
to
the
common
stem
of
marsupials
and
placentals
.
Species
of
dryolestids
,
therefore
,
have
become
central
to
understanding
the
early
evolution
of
tribosphenic
mammals
.
Previous
investigations
of
dryolestids
were
based
mainly
upon
fossils
from
the
Morrison
Formation
of
the
North
American
Rocky
Mountains
and
the
approximately
contemporaneous
Purbeck
beds
of
southern
England
;
most
of
the
specimens
were
fragmentary
jaws
and
isolated
teeth
.
In
marked
contrast
,
the
present
study
had
about
400
available
dryolestid
dentitions
,
some
essentially
complete
.
The
focus
of
this
study
involved
two
collecting
areas
in
southwestern
Portugal
,
both
north
of
Lisbon
.
The
richer
area
is
from
an
abandoned
,
underground
lignite
mine
in
a
southern
district
of
the
city
of
Leiria
known
as
Guimarota
.
Fossils
were
collected
at
the
Guimarota
mine
by
paleontologists
from
the
Free
University
of
Berlin
after
commercial
mining
had
stopped
.
Collecting
was
prolonged
at
Guimarota
,
initiated
through
the
interval
of
1952-1962
and
resuming
,
much
more
intensely
,
from
1973-1982
.
As
a
result
of
collecting
and
curatorial
efforts
that
can
only
be
considered
heroic
,
Guimarota
now
provides
the
richest
and
most
diverse
assemblage
of
Late
Jurassic
,
nonmarine
small
vertebrates
known
to
the
paleontological
world
.
Smaller
samples
also
were
recovered
by
the
same
German
teams
from
the
beautiful
sea
cliffs
at
Porto
Pinheiro
,
southwest
of
the
town
of
Lourinha
(
halfway
between
Lisbon
and
Leiria
)
.
Martin
's
monograph
provides
the
best
maps
published
for
locating
the
sites
of
Guimarota
and
Porto
Pinheiro
.
Dryolestids
compose
about
half
of
the
mammalian
specimens
from
Guimarota
.
The
others
include
paurodontids
(
another
family
of
"
eupantotheres
"
),
a
considerable
variety
of
multituberculates
,
and
a
single
,
enigmatic
species
of
docodont
.
Despite
the
large
numbers
of
specimens
,
overall
taxonomic
diversity
of
mammals
from
Guimarota
is
not
great
.
Martin
relates
the
peculiar
faunal
-
to
an
extreme
depositional
setting
in
a
coastal
swamp
.
Dinosaurs
are
represented
mostly
by
juveniles
,
and
theropods
constitute
about
90
percent
of
the
isolated
tooth
fossils
.
Possibly
the
rare
species
lived
in
the
drier
uplands
,
and
their
remains
were
carried
only
by
accident
to
points
of
preservation
in
the
coastal
lowlands
of
Guimarota
.
The
oldest
known
dryolestids
come
from
the
late
Bathonian
Forest
Marble
of
Oxfordshire
,
England
.
Dryolestids
from
Guimarota
,
however
,
are
the
oldest
-
representatives
of
the
family
.
Despite
their
antiquity
,
species
from
Guimarota
already
exhibit
the
anteroposteriorly
compressed
molars
characteristic
of
the
family
,
as
well
as
strongly
asymmetrical
roots
(
larger
anterior
root
,
much
smaller
posterior
root
)
and
high
molar
count
.
Species
from
Guimarota
are
more
primitive
,
and
thus
probably
somewhat
older
,
than
their
closest
relatives
from
the
Morrison
Formation
and
English
Weald
.
Dentally
advanced
forms
such
as
Laolestes
are
absent
at
Guimarota
.
Martin
considers
the
age
of
Morrison
Formation
in
the
traditional
sense
(
i.e.
,
late
Kimmeridgian
,
using
European
terminology
)
.
He
thinks
the
sites
at
Porto
Pinheiro
are
younger
than
that
,
speci?cally
late
Kimmeridgian
or
early
Berriasian
;
strata
at
Porto
Pinheiro
,
therefore
,
he
considers
to
have
been
deposited
close
to
the
Jurassic
-
Cretaceous
boundary
.
Martin
recognizes
three
new
genera
of
endemic
Portuguese
dryolestids
,
as
well
as
two
new
species
of
pre-existing
genera
.
Dryolestes
leiriensis
,
sp
.
nov.
(
which
has
a
3.5
cm-long
mandible
)
and
Krebsotherium
lusitanicum
,
gen.
et
sp
.
nov.
(
2.5
cm-long
mandible
)
are
known
from
upper
and
lower
jaws
and
numerically
dominate
the
dryolestids
of
Guimarota
.
Guimarotodus
inflatus
,
gen.
et
sp
.
nov.
,
also
from
Guimarota
,
is
known
only
from
lower
jaws
and
teeth
.
Laolestes
andresi
,
sp
.
nov.
.
and
Portopinheirodo
asymmetricus
,
gen.
et
sp
.
nov.
were
recovered
uniquely
from
Porto
Pinheiro
,
and
both
exhibit
specializations
beyond
those
of
their
relatives
from
Guimarota
.
Martin
considers
"
Butlerigale
"
of
Kiihne
,
originally
a
nomen
nudum
,
as
a
possibly
pathological
variant
within
the
species
limits
of
Dryolestes
leiriensis
.
Based
wholly
upon
new
,
personal
observations
of
type
materials
,
Martin
provides
an
important
and
extensive
section
on
taxonomic
revision
of
dryolestids
from
the
Morrison
Formation
.
Revised
synonymies
and
relationships
of
Morrison
taxa
are
as
follows
:
Dryolestes
leiriensis
is
highly
similar
to
the
lower
jaw
species
Dryolestes
priscus
of
the
Rockies
;
upper
teeth
of
D.
leiriensis
closely
resemble
the
upper
jaw
species
Herpetairus
arcuatus
of
the
Morrison
Formation
,
and
Herpetairus
is
judged
a
junior
synonym
of
Dryolestes
;
Krebsotherium
represents
a
lineage
that
led
to
Amblotherium
of
Europe
and
the
Rockies
;
Laolestes
(
the
senior
genus
)
is
the
lower
dentition
of
Melanodon
,
also
of
both
continents
;
Amblotherium
gracilis
is
the
senior
synonym
of
both
Amblotherium
debilis
and
Kepolestes
coloradensis
Malthacoleste
